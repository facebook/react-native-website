In 2018 the React Native Community made a number of changes about how we develop and communicate about React Native. We believe that a few years from now we will look back and see that this shift was a turning point for React Native.

A lot of people are excited about the rewrite of React Native's architecture, widely known as [Fabric](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4). Among other things, this will fix fundamental limitations in React Native's architecture and will set up React Native for success in the future together with [JSI and TurboModules](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/40).

The biggest shift in 2018 was to empower the React Native Community. From the beginning, Facebook encouraged developers from all around the world to participate in React Native's open source project. Since then, a number of core contributors emerged to handle, among other things, the release process.

This year, these members took a few substantial steps towards making the whole community more able to shape the future of this project; two repositories have been created throughout the year precisely with this goal in mind:

## [`react-native-releases`](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases) üì¨

This repository, started around Feb, serves the dual purpose of allowing everyone to keep up the new releases in a more collaborative manner and opened the conversation of what would be part of a certain release to whoever wanted to suggest a cherry-pick (like for [0.57.8](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/71) and all its previous versions).

This has been the driving force behind moving away from a monthly release cycle, and the "long term support" approach currently used for version 0.57.x.

Half of the merit in reaching these decisions goes to the other repository created this year:

## [`discussions-and-proposals`](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals) üó£

This other ‚Äòmeta‚Äô repository, created in July, expanded on the idea of a more open environment for conversations on React Native; while, partially, this need was covered by a few issues labelled [`For Discussion`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/labels/For%20Discussion) in the main repository, we wanted to give our own spin to the RFC approach that other libraries (like React) have.

This experiment found immediately its role in the React Native lifecycle: even the FB team is now relying heavily on it to discuss what could [be improved in React Native](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/64), and coordinate the efforts around the [Lean Core project](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/6) - among other interesting conversations.

But we are far from done.

### What awaits ahead üéì

As explained above, over the past 6-8 months, the [React Native Community organisation](https://github.com/react-native-community) has been used by core contributors to take more ownership over the development of React Native, and enhance the collaboration with Facebook. But this always lacked the formal structure that similar projects may have in place. 

By enforcing a set of standards for all the packages/repos hosted in it, providing a common place for all the maintainers to help each other and providing quality code, this organisation can set the example for everyone in the larger developer community.

We are planning, for the early 2019, to have this new set of guidelines in place - you can let us know what you think in the [dedicated discussion](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/63), and in the manifesto proposal that will be written soon.

With this last founding stone, we are confident that the community will become more inclusive and when 1.0 will be reached, we will all be able to write (even more) awesome apps, capable of leveraging this joined effort ü§ó

I hope you are as excited as I am in looking at the future of this community, and that I will see all of you involved either in the conversations happening in the repositories listed above - or via the awesome code you‚Äôll produce.

We are aware that our approach to communicate these efforts has not been as effective as we liked, and in an attempt to give you all an easier time keeping up with everything going on in the React Native Community (from releases to active discussions) we created a new twitter account that you can rely on [@ReactNativeComm](https://twitter.com/ReactNativeComm) (if you are not on it remember that you can always watch repositories via GitHub). It will become more actively starting 2019, but feel free to start following it right away üê£

Happy holidays & new year to you all üéÖ
