After months of hard work from hundreds of contributors, the React Native Core team is proud to announce the release of version 0.60. This release handles significant migrations for both Android and iOS platforms, and many issues are resolved too. This blog post covers the highlights of the release. As always though, refer to the changelog for more detailed information. Finally, thank you contributors for helping us make this milestone!

## Focus on Accessibility

Accessibility APIs have many continued improvements, like `announceForAccessibility`, improvements to roles, better action support, flags, and more. Accessibility is a complex science, but we hope these improvements make it a bit easier to be an A11Y. Be sure to check [React Native Open Source Update June 2019](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2019/06/12/react-native-open-source-update#meaningful-community-contributions) for more details on these changes.

## A Fresh Start

React Native's start screen has been updated! Thank you to the many contributors who helped create the new UI. This new "Hello World" will welcome users to the ecosystem in a more friendly, engaging way.

## AndroidX Support

[AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) is a major step forward in the Android ecosystem, and the old support library artifacts are being deprecated. In 0.60, React Native is migrated over to AndroidX. This is a breaking change, and your native code and dependencies will need to be migrated as well.

> With this change, React Native apps will need to begin using AndroidX themselves. They cannot be used side-by-side in one app, so all of the app code and dependency code needs to be using one or the other.

While your own native code will need to be migrated by you, [@mikehardy](https://github.com/mikehardy) built a [clever tool](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier) to patch your `node_modules` while library maintainers are still working on releasing upgrades themselves. So if you find errors related to AndroidX migration, give this a shot.

## Cocoapods by Default

[CocoaPods are now part of React Native's iOS project](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0004-cocoapods-support-improvements.md). At the same time, the `podspec`s for the internal packages have changed to make them in sync with the Xcode projects, which will help with troubleshooting and debugging. Expect to make some straightforward changes to your `Podfile` as part of the upgrade to 0.60 to bring this exciting support.

## Lean Core Removals

**WebView** and **NetInfo** were previously extracted into separate repositories, and in 0.60 we’ve finished migrating them out of the React Native repository. Additionally, in response to community feedback about new App Store policy, **Geolocation** has been extracted. If you haven’t already, complete your migration by depending on [react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview), [@react-native-community/netinfo](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-netinfo), and [@react-native-community/geolocation](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-geolocation). Maintainers have made more than 100 commits to these repositories since extraction; we’re excited to see the community’s support!

## Native Modules are now Autolinked

The team working on [the cli](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli) has introduced major improvements to native module linking called [autolinking](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/autolinking.md)! With it, the `react-native link` command is replaced by automatic native platform package linking, with no additional steps required. At the same time, the team overhauled the linking process in general. Let us know what you think using the hashtag [#autolinkingInRN](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?hashtags=autolinkingInRN).

## Upgrade Helper

[@lucasbento](https://github.com/lucasbento), [@pvinis](https://github.com/pvinis), [@kelset](https://github.com/kelset), and [@watadarkstar](https://github.com/watadarkstar) have built a great tool called [Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) to make the upgrade process simpler. This helps React Native users with brownfield apps or complex customizations more quickly see what's changed between versions. Take a look at the [upgrade from 0.59.9 to 0.60.0](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/?from=0.59.9&to=0.60.0) and try it out today for your upgrade path!

## A Note to Library Maintainers

Changes for AndroidX will almost certainly require updates to your library, so be sure to bring support soon. If you're not able to upgrade yet, consider checking your library against the jetifier to confirm users are able to patch your library at build time.

Depending on how your library was previously integrated, you may also need to make some changes. Check the [dependencies](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/blob/master/docs/dependencies.md) guide from the CLI for information on how to define your dependency interface.

## Thanks

While these are the highlights that we noted, there are many others to be excited about. To see all of the updates, take a look at the [changelog](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). As always, stay tuned for more exciting changes in the future. Enjoy 0.60 in the meantime.
