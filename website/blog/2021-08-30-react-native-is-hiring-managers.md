We recently shared [React Native’s Many Platform Vision](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/26/many-platform-vision) for how expanding React to other platforms improves the framework for everyone else. We’ve been making significant progress on this vision over the last couple years by partnering with Microsoft on React Native for Windows and macOS, and Oculus on React Native in VR.

As [part of our plans beginning earlier this year](https://reactnative.dev/blog/2021/08/19/h2-2021), we are growing our focus on these platforms and growing our teams to help us achieve our vision. In order to support our new teammates, and many more to come, **we are hiring two Engineering Managers: one to help support React Native for Desktop, and one to support React Native for VR**.
