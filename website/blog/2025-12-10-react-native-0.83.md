## React 19.2

This release includes React 19.2, bringing the new `<Activity>` and `useEffectEvent` APIs to React Native.

:::warning Important: [CVE-2025-55182](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components)

At time of release, `react-native@0.83.0` depends on `react@19.2.0`, and you might also have seen the recent [Critical Security Vulnerability in React Server Components](https://react.dev/blog/2025/12/03/critical-security-vulnerability-in-react-server-components).

We want to stress that **React Native is NOT directly affected by this vulnerability**, as it does not depend on the impacted packages:

- `react-server-dom-webpack`
- `react-server-dom-parcel`
- `react-server-dom-turbopack`

**However**, if you are using React Native as part of a **monorepo** where these packages may be present, please check and upgrade them immediately.

We will update all React dependencies to `19.2.1` in our next patch release.

:::

### `<Activity>`

`<Activity>` lets you break your app into "activities" that can be controlled and prioritized. You can use Activity as an alternative to conditionally rendering parts of your app, and it currently supports 2 modes: `'visible'` and `'hidden'`.

- `hidden`: hides the children, unmounts effects, and defers all updates until React has nothing left to work on.
- `visible`: shows the children, mounts effects, and allows updates to be processed normally.

One interesting feature of trees hidden using `<Activity mode='hidden'>` is that they preserve their state. So, when they become visible again, they, for example, keep the search status and the selection from a previous user interaction.

| React 19.1.1                                      | React 19.2.1                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| ![](/blog/assets/0.83-react-19.2-no-activity.gif) | ![](/blog/assets/0.83-react-19.2-activity.gif) |

You can read more about `<Activity>` in the [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/Activity).

### `useEffectEvent`

One common pattern with `useEffect` is to notify the app code about some kind of "event" from an external system. The problem with this approach is that a change to any value used inside such an event will cause the surrounding Effect to re-run.

To solve this, most users disable the lint rule and exclude the dependency. But that can lead to bugs since the linter can no longer help you keep the dependencies up to date if you need to update the Effect later.

With `useEffectEvent`, you can split the "event" part of this logic out of the Effect that emits it.

You can read more about `useEffectEvent` in the [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffectEvent).

## New DevTools features

In 0.83 we're excited to deliver some long awaited features and quality of life improvements to React Native DevTools.

### Network and Performance panels

Network inspection and performance tracing are two powerful new capabilities in React Native DevTools, available today.

![Network panel list in React Native DevTools](/docs/assets/debugging-rndt-network.jpg)

**Network inspection**, now available for all React Native apps, allows you to view and understand the network requests made by your app. Logged requests provide detailed metadata such as timings and headers sent/received, as well as response previews. And — for the first time — you can use the Initiator tab to see where in your code a network request originated.

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Network event coverage, Expo support</strong></summary>

**Which network events are captured?**

Today, we record all network calls through `fetch()`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and `<Image>` — with support for custom networking libraries, such as Expo Fetch, coming later.

**Expo Network differences**

Because of this, apps using Expo will continue to see the "Expo Network" panel — a separate implementation by the Expo framework which will log these additional request sources but has slightly reduced features.

- Coverage for Expo-specific network events.
- No request initiator support.
- No Performance panel integration.

We're working with Expo to integrate Expo Fetch and third party networking libraries with our new Network inspection pipeline in future releases.

</details>

![A performance trace in React Native DevTools](/docs/assets/debugging-rndt-performance.jpg)

**Performance tracing** allows you to record a performance session within your app to understand how your JavaScript code is running and what operations took the most time. In React Native, we show JavaScript execution, React Performance tracks, Network events, and custom [User Timings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API/User_timing), rendered in a single performance timeline.

Together with support for the Web Performance APIs in 0.83, this is a powerful feature set providing fine-grained visibility into what might be making your React Native apps slow. We encourage everyone to try out the Performance panel and make it a part of your daily workflow.

Learn more about our newest [React Native DevTools features](/docs/react-native-devtools) and [React Performance tracks](https://react.dev/reference/dev-tools/react-performance-tracks).

### New desktop app

Previously, React Native DevTools launched in a browser window and required Chrome or Edge to be installed. Today, we're introducing a vastly improved desktop experience with our new bundled desktop app. It features:

- **The same zero-install setup as before**, now with **no web browser requirement**.
- **Faster launch** via a lightweight and notarized desktop binary. In rare cases where this cannot be downloaded (such as a corporate firewall), we fall back to the previous browser launch flow.
- **Better windowing**, with improved multitasking on macOS, auto-raise on breakpoint, auto-raise when reconnecting to the same app, and saved window arrangements on relaunch.
- **Improved reliability** by running DevTools separately from your personal browser profile. In particular, this resolves bug reports we have received about certain preinstalled Chrome extensions causing React Native DevTools to break.

## Intersection Observers (Canary)

As part of our effort to bring web APIs to React Native, we have added support for [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) in the [canary release](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/releases/release-levels#how-to-initialize-react-native-using-canary--experimental) for 0.83.

`IntersectionObserver` allows you to asynchronously observe layout intersections between a target element and its ancestor. Please see our [API](https://reactnative.dev/docs/next/global-intersectionobserver) and [implementation docs](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/src/private/webapis/intersectionobserver/__docs__/README.md) for more details. We've also included [examples](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/IntersectionObserver) in RNTester.

## Other changes

### Web Performance APIs as stable

As introduced in 0.82, React Native now implements a subset of the [Performance APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Performance_API) available on Web — now rolled out as stable:

- [High Resolution Time](https://www.w3.org/TR/hr-time-3/): defines `performance.now()` and `performance.timeOrigin`.
- [Performance Timeline](https://w3c.github.io/performance-timeline/): defines `PerformanceObserver` and methods to access performance entries in the performance object (`getEntries()`, `getEntriesByType()`, `getEntriesByName()`).
- [User Timing](https://w3c.github.io/user-timing/): defines `performance.mark` and `performance.measure`.
- [Event Timing API](https://w3c.github.io/event-timing/): defines `event` entry types reported to `PerformanceObserver`.
- [Long Tasks API](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/): defines `longtask` entry types reported to `PerformanceObserver`.

These APIs allow tracking different aspects of performance in your app, visible in the Performance panel in React Native DevTools, as well as at runtime via `PerformanceObserver`.

`PerformanceObserver` also works in production builds, opening new opportunities for capturing real world performance metrics in your apps.

### Experimental - Hermes V1

![Hermes logo](/blog/assets/0.83-hermes-v1.jpg)

Hermes V1 is the next evolution of Hermes, with improvements in the compiler and the VM that significantly boost JavaScript performance.

In React Native 0.82, we released Hermes V1 as an experimental opt-in. And in 0.83, Hermes V1 includes further performance improvements.

<details>
<summary><strong>💡 Enabling Hermes V1</strong></summary>

**Note**: While Hermes V1 is in the experimental phase, you’ll need to build React Native from source to try it out.

To try Hermes V1 in your own project, use the following steps:

1. Force your package manager to resolve the experimental version of Hermes V1 compiler package by modifying the corresponding section of your package.json file (note that the current versioning convention is only for the experimental phase of Hermes V1):

  <div style={{marginLeft: 'var(--ifm-list-left-padding)'}}>
  <Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn">
   ```json title="package.json"
   "resolutions": { "hermes-compiler": "250829098.0.4" }
   ```
   </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">
   ```json title="package.json"
   "overrides": { "hermes-compiler": "250829098.0.4" }
   ```
   </TabItem>
   </Tabs>
   </div>

2. Enable Hermes V1 for Android by adding hermesV1Enabled=true inside `android/gradle.properties`:

   ```gradle title="android/gradle.properties"
   hermesV1Enabled=true
   ```

   Also, configure React Native to build from source by editing android/settings.gradle:

   ```gradle title="android/settings.gradle"
     includeBuild('../node_modules/react-native') {
         dependencySubstitution {
             substitute(module("com.facebook.react:react-android")).using(project(":packages:react-native:ReactAndroid"))
             substitute(module("com.facebook.react:react-native")).using(project(":packages:react-native:ReactAndroid"))
             substitute(project(":packages:react-native:ReactAndroid:hermes-engine")).using(module("com.facebook.hermes:hermes-android:250829098.0.1"))
         }
     }
   ```

3. Enable Hermes V1 for iOS by installing pods with `RCT_HERMES_V1_ENABLED=1` environment variable.

   ```
   RCT_HERMES_V1_ENABLED=1 bundle exec pod install
   ```

   Keep in mind that Hermes V1 is not compatible with the precompiled React Native builds, so make sure you don’t use the `RCT_USE_PREBUILT_RNCORE` flag when installing pods.

4. To confirm if your app is running Hermes V1, execute the following code within your app or the DevTools console. This code will return the Hermes version, which should match the version specified in step 1 (250829098.0.1):

   ```ts
   // expecting "250829098.0.1" in Hermes V1
   HermesInternal.getRuntimeProperties()['OSS Release Version'];
   ```

</details>

### Experimental - Compile out the Legacy Architecture on iOS

In this release, we are adding a new flag for iOS that allows you to compile out the Legacy Architecture from the codebase.
If your app is already on the New Architecture, you can try to remove the legacy architecture code by installing your pods with:

```
RCT_REMOVE_LEGACY_ARCH=1 bundle exec pod install
```

This should reduce both the build time and the size of your app. The improvements depend on how many third party libraries you are using: in our tests, using a new app without dependencies, the build time was reduced from 73.0 seconds to 58.2 seconds, and the app size went from 51.2 Mb to 48.2 Mb.

:::info
`RCT_REMOVE_LEGACY_ARCH` is not compatible with React Native precompiled binaries. If you are using precompiled binaries, you'll need to reinstall the pods and build the app from source.
:::

### Experimental - Debug your precompiled binaries on iOS

In this release, we've implemented the ability to debug the React Native code that is shipped with a precompiled binary. This is primarily helpful to library maintainers or if you are developing a native module or a native component.

To debug the binary code shipped with the React Native precompiled binary, follow these steps:

```sh
# From the ios folder of your project
bundle exec pod cache clean --all
bundle exec pod deintegrate
RCT_USE_RN_DEP=1 RCT_USE_PREBUILT_RNCORE=1
RCT_SYMBOLICATE_PREBUILT_FRAMEWORKS=1 bundle exec pod install
open <your-project>.xcworkspace
```

The magic is done by the `RCT_SYMBOLICATE_PREBUILT_FRAMEWORKS` flag, which instructs CocoaPods to download the React Native dSYM files and expand them in the proper folder.

At this point, you can put a breakpoint in your app, for example in `AppDelegate.swift`, and build and run the app from Xcode.

When the application pauses, open the Xcode console and run the LLDB command:

```sh
# If you are running the app in the simulator
add-dsym <path-to-your-app>/ios/Pods/React-Core-prebuilt/React.xcframework/ios-arm64_x86_64-simulator/React.framework/dSYMs/React.framework.dSYM

# If you are running the app on a physical device
add-dsym <path-to-your-app>/ios/Pods/React-Core-prebuilt/React.xcframework/ios-arm64/React.framework/dSYMs/React.framework.dSYM
```

Now you can step into the React Native code.

## Breaking Changes

We're working hard to make React Native releases more predictable and easier to upgrade. React Native 0.83 is the first release with **no user facing breaking changes**.

If you are on React Native 0.82, you should be able to upgrade your app to React Native 0.83 without any changes to your app code.

To learn more about what we consider a breaking change, have a look at [this article](link-to-breaking-changes).

## Deprecations

This release ships two deprecations that are Android specific:

- **Networking**: The `sendRequestInternal` method is being phased out and it is now deprecated.
- **Animation**: `startOperationBatch` and `finishOperationBatch` are now deprecated.
