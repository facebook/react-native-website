Today we’re releasing React Native version 0.62 which includes support for Flipper by default.

This release comes in the midst of a global pandemic. We’re releasing this version today to respect the work of hundreds of contributors who made this release possible and to prevent the release from falling too far behind master. Please be mindful of the reduced capacity of contributors to help with issues and prepare to delay upgrading if necessary.

## Flipper by default

[Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/) is a developer tool for debugging mobile apps. It’s popular in the Android and iOS communities, and in this release we’ve enabled support by default for new and existing React Native apps.

Flipper provides the following features out of the box:

- Network Inspector
- Layout Inspector
- Crash Reporter
- Device logs

There is also a marketplace of custom Flipper plugins you can install:

For more information, check out the [Flipper documentation](https://fbflipper.com/docs/features/react-native.html).

## Better dark mode support

We’ve added a new `Appearance` module to provide access to the user's appearance preferences, such as their preferred color scheme (light or dark).

```
const colorScheme = Appearance.getColorScheme();
if (colorScheme === 'dark') {
  // Use dark color scheme
}
```

We’ve also added a hook to subscribe to state updates to the users preferences:

```
import {Text, useColorScheme} from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  return <Text>useColorScheme(): {colorScheme}</Text>;
};
```

See the docs for [Appearance](https://reactnative.dev/docs/appearance) and [useColorScheme](https://reactnative.dev/docs/usecolorscheme) for more information.

## Moving Apple TV to react-native-tvos

As part of our [Lean Core effort](https://reactnative.dev/blog/#lean-core) and to bring Apple TV in line with other platforms like React Native Windows and React Native macOS, we’ve started to remove Apple TV specific code from core.

Going forward, Apple TV support for React Native will be maintained in [react-native-community/react-native-tvos](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-tvos) along with the corresponding `react-native-tvos` NPM package. This is a full fork of the main repository, with only the changes needed to support Apple TV.

Releases of `react-native-tvos` will be based on the public release of React Native. For this 0.62 release of `react-native` please upgrade Apple TV projects to use `react-native-tvos` 0.62.

## Other Improvements

- **LogBox**: We’re adding the new LogBox error and warning experience as an opt-in; to enable it, add `require('react-native').unstable_enableLogBox()` to your `index.js` file.
- **React DevTools v4**: This change includes an upgrade to the [latest React DevTools](https://reactjs.org/blog/2019/08/15/new-react-devtools.html) which offers significant performance gains, an improved navigation experience, and full support for React Hooks.
- **Accessibility improvements**: We’ve made improvements to accessibility including adding [accessibilityValue](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility#accessibilityvalue-ios-android), missing props on [Touchables](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/8c0c860e38f57e18296f689e47dfb4a54088c260), onSlidingComplete [accessibility events](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c7aa6dc8270c0eabc913fe6c617c8131e3f4b3c5), and changing the default role of Switch component from ‘button’ to ‘switch’.

## Breaking Changes

- **Remove PropTypes**: We're removing `propTypes` from core components in order to release the app size impact of React Native core and to favor static type systems which check at compile time instead of runtime.
- **Remove accessibilityStates**: We’ve [removed](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/7b35f427fd66cb0f36921b992095fe5b3c14d8b9) the deprecated `accessibilityStates` property in favor of the new `accessibilityState` prop which is a more semantically rich way for components to describe information about their state to accessibility services.
- **TextInput changes**: We removed `onTextInput` [from TextInput](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3f7e0a2c9601fc186f25bfd794cd0008ac3983ab) as it’s uncommon, not W3C compliant, and difficult to implement in [Fabric](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/issues/4). We also removed the undocumented `inputView` prop, and `selectionState`.

## Deprecations

- `AccessibilityInfo.fetch` was already deprecated, but in this release we [added a warning](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/523ab8333800afbfb169c6fd70ab6611fe07cc2a).
- Setting `useNativeDriver` is [now required](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5876052615f4858ed5fc32fa3da9b64695974238) to support switching the default in the future.
- The `ref` of an `Animated` component is now the internal component and `getNode` has [been deprecated](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/66e72bb4e00aafbcb9f450ed5db261d98f99f82a).
