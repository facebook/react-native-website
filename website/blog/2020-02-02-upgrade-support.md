After a ton of helpful feedback and discussion by the React Native community, we are eager to announce [Upgrade-Support](https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-support), a central place to request and give help when upgrading your app. We welcome every React Native developer to post their issues as well as their solutions to problems encountered when upgrading their applications.

This initiative is part of the React Native Community efforts to minimize the work on upgrading your React Native applications.

## How it works

[Upgrade-Support](https://github.com/react-native-community/upgrade-support) is merely a GitHub repository and depends on its users' cooperation in order to work easily and sucessfully, all the questions and solutions are shared through issues.

### Asking for help

If you have trouble upgrading your application, you can click on the `Issues` tab and choose the `Question` option that is shown:

The page for issue creation is then opened, there you must fulfill the information requested on the prefilled issue body and, after making sure that every bit of information has been provided, your issue should look something like this:

### Providing a solution

If you went through a problem during your application upgrade process and managed to solve it, we very much welcome a quick write-down of how you did it so other developers can easily find solutions to their issues.
