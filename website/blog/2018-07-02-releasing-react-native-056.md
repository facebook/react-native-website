If you are reading this, it means that the long-awaited 0.56 version of React Native has, officially, been released üéâ.

This blog post highlights some of the [changes](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#highlights) that this massive new version introduces and explains what we've been busy with since May.

### The breaking changes dilemma, or, "when to release?"

React Native changes go through a multi-step integration process to keep up with the internal Facebook team (read about it in the [How To Contribute Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/contributing#our-development-process)). And since it is also composed of [many different tools](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website/issues/370), coordination and constant support to keep the framework working properly are necessary. Add then the vibrant community of developers in the open source world who contribute to make it better, and you will see the mindbending scale of it all.

With React Native's impressive adoption, breaking changes must be made with great care: this process isn't as quick as desired. Couple that with an inconvenient timing for many contributors during this first half of 2018, and a decision was forced to skip the April and May monthly releases. Instead, the core team bundled the first 0.56 release candidate with the intent of gradually testing the new breaking changes to a smaller portion of courageous volunteers. [Dedicated community communication](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/issues/14) channels were used along the way to ensure that 0.56.0 will be as hassle-free as possible to adopt by those who patiently waited for the stable release.

Is 0.56.0 perfect? No, as every piece of software out there: but we reached a point where the tradeoff between "waiting for more stability" versus "testing led to successful results" that we feel ready to release it. Moreover, we are aware that a few issues that have been opened don't have yet a solution ( [19827](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19827), [19763](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19763), [19859](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19859), [19955](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19955) ) we hope that by releasing 0.56.0 the surface of developers interacting to find solutions to them will allow for faster resolution.

Because of these reasons, you should consider 0.56 as a fundamental building block towards a more stable framework: it will take probably a week or two of widespread adoption before all the edge cases will be sanded off, but this will lead to an even better 0.57, for which we plan to go back to the monthly release schedule.

We'd like to conclude this section by thanking [all the 62 contributors who worked on the massive 803 commits](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/compare/v0.55.4...v0.56.0-rc.4) (!) that will make your apps even better üëè

And now, without further ado...

## The Big Changes

### Babel 7

As you may know, the transpiler tool that allows us all to use the latest & greatest features of JS, Babel, is moving to [v7 soon](https://babeljs.io/blog/2017/12/27/nearing-the-7.0-release). Since this new version brings along some important changes, we felt that now it would be a good time to upgrade to it, allowing [Metro](https://github.com/facebook/metro) to leverage on its improvements (you can find the original issue discussing it [here](https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/92)).

If you find yourself in trouble with upgrading, please refer to the [documentation section related to it](https://new.babeljs.io/docs/en/next/v7-migration.html).

### Modernizing Android support

On Android, much of the surrounding tooling has changed. We've updated to [Gradle 3.5](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/699e5eebe807d1ced660d2d2f39b5679d26925da), [Android SDK 26](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/065c5b6590de18281a8c592a04240751c655c03c), [Fresco to 1.9.0, and OkHttp to 3.10.0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/6b07602915157f54c39adbf0f9746ac056ad2d13) and even the [NDK API target to API 16](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/5ae97990418db613cd67b1fb9070ece976d17dc7). These changes should go without issue, and they lead to faster builds, fewer crashes, and be compliant with [Google new requirements](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/12/improving-app-security-and-performance.html).

Related to this, we'd like to particularly thank [Dulmandakh](https://github.com/dulmandakh) for the many PRs submitted in order to make it possible üëè

There are some more steps that need to be taken in this direction, and you can follow along with the future planning and discussion of updating the Android support in the [dedicated issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19297) (and the side one for [JSC](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/19737)).

### New Node, XCode, React and Flow ‚Äì oh my!

Node 8 is now the standard for React Native. It was actually already being tested already, but we've put both feet forward with Node 6 entering maintenance mode. So, please expect that Node 8 is now required. React was also updated to 16.4, which brings a ton of fixes with it.

[iOS 9 is now the target](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f50df4f5eca4b4324ff18a49dcf8be3694482b51), and the CI build toolchain has been updated [to use XCode 9.4](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/c55bcd6ea729cdf57fc14a5478b7c2e3f6b2a94d). These changes are most likely less impact than Android's, but still noteworthy nonetheless.

And for those of you that are enforcing typing via Flow, we upgraded to [0.74](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/3bed272a620ac806a6142327013265ea8138641a) to use the new error format [that many devs appreciate](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/998610821096857602) and created types for many more components.

### And a lot of other things

For instance, YellowBox was ~~updated~~ [replaced](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d0219a0301e59e8b0ef75dbd786318d4b4619f4c) with a new implementation that makes debugging a lot better.

For the complete release notes, please reference the full [changelog here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
And remember to keep an eye on the [upgrading guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html) to avoid issues moving to this new version.

A final note: starting this week, the React Native core team will resume holding monthly meetings. We'll make sure to keep everyone up-to-date with what's covered, and ensure to keep your feedback at hand for future meetings.

Happy coding everyone!

**PS:** as always, we'd like to remind everyone that React Native is still in 0.x versioning because of the many changes still undergoing - so remember when upgrading that yes, probably, something may still crash or be broken. Be helpful towards each other in the issues and when submitting PRs - and remember to follow the [CoC](https://code.fb.com/codeofconduct/) enforced: there's always a human on the other side of the screen.
