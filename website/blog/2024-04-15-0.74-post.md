## Batched `onLayout` updates (New Architecture)

State updates in `onLayout` callbacks are now batched. Prior, each state update in the `onLayout` event would result in a new render commit.

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  const [state1, setState1] = useState(false);
  const [state2, setState2] = useState(false);

  return (
    <View>
      <View
        onLayout={() => {
          setState1(true);
       }}>
      <View
         onLayout={() => {
          // When this event is executed, state1's new value is no longer observable here.
          setState2(true);
        }}>
 	    </View>
    </View>
  );
}
```

In 0.74, `setState1` and `setState2` updates are batched together. This change is [expected behavior in React](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates#react-batches-state-updates) and allows for less re-renders.

:::danger
This change may break code that has relied on un-batched state updates. You'll need to refactor this code to use [updater functions](https://react.dev/learn/queueing-a-series-of-state-updates#updating-the-same-state-multiple-times-before-the-next-render) or equivalent.

## Deprecated `PropTypes` Removed

Before 0.74, React Native shipped with `PropTypes` even though they have been deprecated since React 15.5 in 2017! The presence of this deprecated code incurs costs in increased app size and memory overhead for apps that follow best practices.

Starting in 0.74, React Native will no longer include the following `PropTypes` properties: `Image.propTypes`, `Text.propTypes`, `TextInput.propTypes`, `ColorPropType`, `EdgeInsetsPropType`, `PointPropType`, `ViewPropTypes`

If your app or library relies on `PropTypes`, we highly recommend migrating to a type system like TypeScript. **If you have trouble identifying the source of a deleted `PropTypes` usage, please [file an issue](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues) so we can help track it down with you.**

## Deprecated APIs in `PushNotificationIOS`

:::warning
The [PushNotificationIOS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pushnotificationios) library is marked as deprecated. The changes in this release are focused on removing references to deprecated iOS APIs. In a future release, this library will be moved out of react-native core and converged with the community package, [@react-native-community/push-notification-ios](https://github.com/react-native-push-notification/ios).
:::

[PushNotificationIOS](https://reactnative.dev/docs/pushnotificationios) has been migrated onto Apple’s [User Notification](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications?language=objc) framework and exposes new APIs for scheduling and handling notifications. If you are still relying on PushNotificationIOS, you’ll need to migrate over before the next release (0.75) when the deprecated APIs will be removed.

### API Changes

The `didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:` callback on `RCTPushNotificationManager` was a no-op and has been deleted.

The following callbacks on `RCTPushNotificationManager` have been deprecated and will be removed in 0.75:

```objectivec
+ (void)didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification;
+ (void)didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)notification;
```

In order to retrieve the notification which launched the app using `getInitialNotification()`, you’ll now need to explicitly set the `initialNotification` on `RCTPushNotificationManager`:

```objectivec
[RCTPushNotificationManager setInitialNotification:response.notification];
```

On the JS side, properties on `Notification` have changed. `alertAction` and `repeatInterval` are now deprecated and will be removed in 0.75:

```js
type Notification = {|
 ...
 +fireDate?: ?number,
 /** NEW. Seconds from now to display the notification. */
 +fireIntervalSeconds?: ?number,
 /**
  * CHANGED. Used only for scheduling notifications. Will be null when
  * retrieving notifications using `getScheduledLocalNotifications` or
  * `getDeliveredNotifications`.
  */
 +soundName?: ?string,
 /** DEPRECATED. This was used for iOS's legacy UILocalNotification. */
 +alertAction?: ?string,
 /** DEPRECATED. Use `fireDate` or `fireIntervalSeconds` instead. */
 +repeatInterval?: ?string,
|};

```

Finally, the `handler` parameter on `PushNotificationIOS.removeEventListener` is unused and has been removed.

### How to Migrate

#### iOS

Your `AppDelegate` will need to implement `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`. This should be done on app startup in `application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` or `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` (see [Apple Docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate?language=objc) for more details).

```objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ...
  UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
  center.delegate = self;

  return YES;
}
```

Implement <code>[userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/1649518-usernotificationcenter?language=objc)</code>, which is called when a notification arrives and the app is in the <em>foreground</em>. Use the <code>completionHandler</code> to determine if the notification will be shown to the user and notify <code>RCTPushNotificationManager</code> accordingly:

```objectivec
- (void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
       willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification
         withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions options))completionHandler
{
  // This will trigger 'notification' and 'localNotification' events on PushNotificationIOS
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveNotification:notification];
  // Decide if and how the notification will be shown to the user
  completionHandler(UNNotificationPresentationOptionNone);
}
```

To handle when a notification is tapped, implement <code>[userNotificationCenter:didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unusernotificationcenterdelegate/1649501-usernotificationcenter?language=objc)</code>. Note that if you set foreground notifications to be shown in <code>userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:</code>, you should only notify <code>RCTPushNotificationManager</code> in one of these callbacks.

If the tapped notification resulted in app launch, call `setInitialNotification:`. If the notification was not previously handled by `userNotificationCenter:willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:`, call `didReceiveNotification:` as well:

```objectivec
- (void)  userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center
  didReceiveNotificationResponse:(UNNotificationResponse *)response
           withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completionHandler
{
  // This condition passes if the notification was tapped to launch the app
  if ([response.actionIdentifier isEqualToString:UNNotificationDefaultActionIdentifier]) {
  // Allow the notification to be retrieved on the JS side using getInitialNotification()
    [RCTPushNotificationManager setInitialNotification:response.notification];
  }
 // This will trigger 'notification' and 'localNotification' events on PushNotificationIOS
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveNotification:response.notification];
  completionHandler();
}
```

Finally, delete the following methods and adapt the logic into the callbacks above which will be called instead:

1. <code>[application:didReceiveLocalNotification:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622930-application?language=objc)</code> [deprecated]
2. <code>[application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623117-application?language=objc)</code> [deprecated]
3. <code>[application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623013-application?language=objc)</code> [not deprecated, but is superseded by the <code>UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate</code> methods]

Delete any usages of <code>[application:didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623022-application?language=objc)</code> and <code>RCTPushNotificationManager</code>’s corresponding <code>didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:</code> as well.

**Example:** See the RNTester <code>[AppDelegate.mm](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/rn-tester/RNTester/AppDelegate.mm)</code>.

#### JS

1. Remove any references to `alertAction`.
2. Remove the `handler` argument on any calls to `removeEventListener`.
3. Replace any usages of `repeatInterval` by firing multiple notifications using `fireDate` or `fireIntervalSeconds` instead.
4. Note that `soundName` will be null when it is accessed on a `Notification` returned from `getScheduledLocalNotifications()` and `getDeliveredNotifications()`.
