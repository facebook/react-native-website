### Help us testing üß™

<!-- TODO Add the call to action for something specific that we want folks to test -->

Let us know how it went by posting a comment in the [working group discussion](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions)! Please specify with system you tried it on (ex. macos, windows).

**Bonus points:** It would be even better if you could swap things around: instead of using a fresh new app, use a more complex one - or use a different library that is already leveraging the new architecture!
