:::info
Documents in this section go over steps to run different types of React Native release updates. Its intended audience is those in [relevant release roles](./release-roles-responsibilites.md).
:::

### Pre-requisites

- You have some pick requests that qualify for a patch release in the "should we release 0.Y.Z?" [discussion](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions).
- Write access to [react-native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) repository.
- Write access to [releases](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases) repository.
- One CircleCI personal API token - see [here](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/managing-api-tokens/#creating-a-personal-api-token) how to set one.

### 1. Check out the latest version from release branch

```bash
# Be on relevant release branch
# update the stable branch with tags
git pull origin <release-branch> --tags

# cherry pick relevant commits
git cherry-pick <commit>
```

### 2. Bump monorepo packages

**For 0.74 and later:**

Skip this step — we'll version the monorepo package dependencies _after local testing_.

**For 0.72-0.73:**

Update all packages in the monorepo that were modified by the cherry picks. You can do it by running:

```sh
yarn bump-all-updated-packages # All the package bumps must be on the patch level
git push origin 0.XX-stable
```

After pushing, the CI will take care to publish the new packages automatically.

**For 0.71:**

```sh
yarn bump-all-updated-packages
git push origin 0.71-stable
```

This will trigger a CI pipeline that will publish the changed packages. Once those packages are published (the new versions are on npm), run:

```sh
yarn align-package-versions
```

**For 0.70:**
For version 0.70, packages must be released manually by a Meta engineer.

### 3. Test the current changes

Before continuing further, follow the [testing guide](/contributing/release-testing) to ensure the source code doesn't have any major issues.

<AsyncTestingNote/>

### 4. (0.74 and later only) Bump monorepo packages

- Version the monorepo package dependencies by running `yarn bump-all-updated-packages`.
- Push the newly generated commit. A CI workflow will publish the new versions of each monorepo package (excluding `react-native`) to npm.
- Wait for this workflow to successfully complete before continuing.

```sh
yarn bump-all-updated-packages # All the package bumps must be on the patch level
git push origin 0.XX-stable
```

### 5. Run `trigger-react-native-release` script

```bash
# once verified all the cherry-picked commits, we can push them to remote
git push

# run a script to bump the version
# If you are doing this patch release for the current latest minor, then mark it as "latest"
yarn trigger-react-native-release --to-version x.y.z --token <YOUR_CIRCLE_CI_TOKEN>
```

### 6. Watch CircleCI to ensure right jobs are being triggered

- Once you have run the bump script script, head to CircleCI and you should see under the releases workflow, a `prepare-package-for-release` job.

  </figure>

- Once complete you should be able to run `npm view react-native` and verify that under the `latest` tag, the version is the expected release version.

  ```bash
  npm view react-native
  ...
  dist-tags:
  latest: 0.Y.Z            next: 0.Y.0-rc.X         nightly: 0.0.0-f617e022c
  ```

### 7. Create a PR of the changelog using the generator

To generate the changelog, we rely on a dedicated tool called [`@rnx-kit/rn-changelog-generator`](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/tree/main/incubator/rn-changelog-generator) that will parse the custom changelog messages that contributors write in their PRs.

```bash
# Run following with the stable release as base, and your patch version
npx @rnx-kit/rn-changelog-generator --base v[LATEST_STABLE]--compare v[YOUR_NEW_MINOR] \
--repo ~/react-native --changelog ~/react-native/CHANGELOG.md

# example against 0.68.2 and 0.68.3
npx @rnx-kit/rn-changelog-generator --base v0.68.2 --compare v0.68.3 \
--repo ~/react-native --changelog ~/react-native/CHANGELOG.md
```

Create a pull request of this change to `react-native` repo and add the `Changelog` label.

### 8. Create GitHub Release

Use template below for the GitHub Release:

```markdown
<!-- Template for a stable patch -->

<!-- You can run `npx @rnx-kit/rn-changelog-generator --base v0.66.0 --compare v0.66.1 --repo path-to-repository/react-native --changelog path-to-repository/react-native/CHANGELOG.md` to generate the markdown for the cherry-picked changes. Make sure to use the right tags in the command and create a new PR with the changes generated by the changelog generator. You can read more about the changelog generator [here](https://github.com/microsoft/rnx-kit/tree/main/incubator/rn-changelog-generator). -->

- TODO Enumerate picks. <!-- use the changelog generated text for this section -->

---

You can participate in the conversation on the status of this release in this [discussion](TODO: your discussion link)

---

To help you upgrade to this version, you can use the [upgrade helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) ⚛️

---

You can find the whole changelog history in the [changelog.md file](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).
```

### 9. Upload prebuilt Hermes binary

In the `publish_release` CI workflow, the `build_hermes_macos` step produces a `tmp/hermes/output/hermes-runtime-darwin-vx.y.z.tar.gz` artifact, for example [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/facebook/react-native/13933/workflows/5f2ad198-2264-4e7e-8c62-7b28e97532d8/jobs/262322/artifacts) are the artifacts for `0.69.0` release. Download it and attach it to the GitHub release.

### 10. Create a new patch discussion post using template below

```markdown
<!-- Template for new patch -->

# Should we release 0.67.1?

Current Release: [0.67.0](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.67.0)

Conversations on this thread are limited:

- [major release issues](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/release-faq#what-is-release-blocking).
- [qualified cherry-pick requests](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/release-faq#what-is-a-qualified-pick-request) of commits on main that [did not make the previous patch version](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/release-faq#how-do-i-know-if-my-fixfeature-is-in-a-certain-release).

Please include a link to the specific commit on main to be cherry-picked, for example: [facebook/react-native@bd2b7d6](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/20b0eba581a00e5e7e300f6377379b836617c147)

In other words, if you cannot point to a particular commit on main, then your request likely belongs as a new issue.
If the issue is a [major release issues](https://reactnative.dev/contributing/release-faq#what-is-release-blocking), please reference the issue here.

#### List of qualified picks

<!-- Keep these in chronological order in time of commit -->

1.

#### Local commits to backport to main

1.
```

### 11. Update "should we release 0.Y.Z?" discussion post

- Label it `Released`.
- Update the text body saying the patch has been released and link to new patch discussion.
- Lock the discussion.

### 12. Verify that Upgrade Helper GitHub action has fired

- You should see a [new publish job here](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge/actions).
- Once it has finished, you should be able to see that the [Upgrade Helper](https://react-native-community.github.io/upgrade-helper/) presents the option to target the new minor.
- If not, check out the guide on [how to update Upgrade Helper](/contributing/updating-upgrade-helper).

### 13. Communicate the new release

Once all the steps above have been completed, it's time to signal to the community that latest minor is available! Do so in the following channels:

- [@reactnative](https://twitter.com/reactnative) on twitter (with a link to the GitHub release)
- RN Discord `#releases-coordination`
