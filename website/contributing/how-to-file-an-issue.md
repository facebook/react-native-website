title: How to File an Issue
---

[GitHub issues](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues) are our main channel for handling bug reports that affect open source consumers.

Proposals and discussions about the architecture of React Native are held on the [Discussions and Proposals](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals) repository.

To increase your chances of resolving your issue quickly, please consider including the following in your issue:

- **The version of React Native that you're using.** Run `react-native info` in a console and copy the results into your issue.
- **The steps to reproduce the issue.** What steps can a person who reads your bug report perform to get the same results? How do these results differ from your expectations?
- **A code example.** Expo's [Snack](https://snack.expo.io/) tool can be used to provide a reproducible example.

### Code-level help

If you're looking for help with your app, please refer to the ample [list of community resources](/community/support). Many members of the community use Stack Overflow to [ask questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-native?sort=frequent) using the **react-native** tag.
