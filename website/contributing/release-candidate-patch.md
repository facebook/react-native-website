### Pre-requisites

- You have some pick requests that qualify for a patch release and people have agreed itâ€™s good to release a patch.

### 1. Check out the latest version from release branch and run `bump-oss-version` script

```bash
# Be on relevant release branch
# update the stable branch with tags
git pull origin <release-branch> --tags

# cherry pick relevant commits
git cherry-pick <commit>

# once done picking, push changes to the remote
git push

# then run a script to bump the version (must be triggered by a Meta employee)
# You most likely **don't** want this release marked as "latest"
./scripts/bump-oss-version.js --version x.y.z-rc.x --token circle-ci-token
```

### 2. Similar to cutting new branch, watch CircleCI to ensure right jobs are being triggered

### 3. Update the relevant discussion post with the latest RC
