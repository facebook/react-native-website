title: Release Dependencies
---

This table wants to highlight the various tooling that we need to pay attention to and potentially bump to ensure that everything works correctly - it could be that some versions need to be only changed/bumped in the [`template`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/tree/main/template) folder.

| Tool                  | Ping team ahead of branch cut?                                                                                                                                                         | Bump when...                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Reference bump                                                                                   | Link to source                                                                    |

| Metro                 | Yes, ping Meta's Metro team - a new version needs to be cut too.                                                                                                                       | During RC phase of new minor, coordinated with RN CLI (see below).                                                                                                                                                           | [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/cfdc4fed0d0ba7860d176c1715c0cc84bea643af) | [source](https://github.com/facebook/metro/tags)                                  |
| RN CLI                | Yes, ping RN CLI maintainers - they need to do a new release that depends on new Metro version (from above), [like so](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/pull/1442/files). | During RC phase of new minor, coordinated with Metro (see above).                                                                                                                                                            | [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31971/files)                                | [source](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli/tags)                      |
| Hermes                | Yes, ping Meta's Hermes team - a new version needs to be cut too.                                                                                                                      | During RC phase of new minor - the closer to the commit of the branch cut, the better.                                                                                                                                       | [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/1d6af14d6d6e5a7e3a773b581600b01934a7d442) | [source](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/tags)                                 |
| Flipper               | No need, they release on their own schedule.                                                                                                                                           | We just need to sync to the newest set of dependencies at the time of branch cut using this as [reference](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/blob/main/react-native/ReactNativeFlipperExample/ios/Podfile#L30).            | [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/31896)                                      | [source](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tags)                                |
| Folly                 | No need, they release on their own schedule.                                                                                                                                           | Usually this dependency gets kept up to date by Meta's internal dev loop so it should be necessary to bump at release cut. But it needs to be the same version that is imported via Flipper (Flipper-Folly) to avoid issues. | [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/b0c8a4eee821ca0b22e166a2a38f2bd2f22a1abe) | [source](https://github.com/facebook/folly/tags)                                  |
| Jest                  | No need, they release on their own schedule.                                                                                                                                           | This will be updated by the Meta engineers to stay aligned to the version used internally - so no relationship with the RN release cycle.                                                                                    | [link](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/d6cd2e6559ff8698833dc277810e2e7e80af760a) | [source](https://github.com/facebook/jest/tags)                                   |
