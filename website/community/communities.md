### Reactiflux Chat

If you need an answer right away, check out the [Reactiflux Discord](https://discord.gg/JuTwWB8rsy) community. There are usually a number of React Native experts there who can help out or point you to somewhere you might want to look.

### Forum-like groups

If you want to create less temporary conversations, check out the [React Native Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/react-native) community or the [React Native Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/react.native.community), which is more focused on post announcements, blog posts, talks, videos, cool new libraries, and apps. [The Expo Forums](https://forums.expo.io) are a good place to get help if you are using Expo.

### Company-based Communities

Some companies actively involved in the React Native have also their own communication channels focused towards the projects they maintain, like [Callstack.io's Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/zwR2Cdh), [Invertase.io's Discord server (e.g. React Native Firebase)](https://discord.gg/C9aK28N), [Infinite Red's Slack Group](http://community.infinite.red/) and [The Expo Slack Group](https://slack.expo.io/).

### Content sharing

[DevTo community's](https://dev.to/t/reactnative) and [Medium's](https://medium.com/tag/react-native) React Native tag are places where you can share React Native projects, articles and tutorials as well as start discussions and ask for feedback on React Native related topics. (but remember to give some love to the [main documentation](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website) too!)
