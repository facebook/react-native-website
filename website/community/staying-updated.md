### News

Twitter is one of the main communication channels used by the team to communicate updates, news and request for participation: follow the [React Native account](https://twitter.com/reactnative) to stay up to date - the [ReactJS account](https://twitter.com/reactjs) covers both React and React Native.

For long form news and announcements, keep an eye on the [blog](blog) to find out what is happening in the world of React Native.

### Discussions and efforts

React Native is a dynamic framework and there is always room for improvement. As an open source framework, large-scale coordination and discussion should remain publicly accessible. Here are some dedicated discussion groups you can participate in:

Expect important conversations to always be public; depending on the topic, you can find them in one of these places:

- [Framework discussions, proposals and RFCs](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals/discussions)
- [Release status and issues](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-releases/discussions)
- [New Architecture adoption and feedback](https://github.com/reactwg/react-native-new-architecture/discussions)
- [Improvements to the Developer Experience](https://github.com/react-native-community/developer-experience-wg)

### Packages & Integrations

In the [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory/) you will be able to see many libraries that are compatible with React Native. It is a community-driven effort to help developers browse and evaluate packages, plugins, state management libraries, and more.

### Conferences

Over the years, many conferences organized by companies and partners have been organized around the world - it would be impossible to track them all here; moreover, often there is React Native content in React events as well.
