### Official channels

The [React Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reactjs) covers both React and React Native. Follow the React Native [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reactnative) and [blog](blog) to find out what's happening in the world of React Native.

### Proposals

React Native is still a young framework, and its rapid release cycle leaves the door open for discussing how it can evolve at every step of the way. If you want to know what the current proposals and RFCs are talking about, you can read through the [Discussions and Proposals repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/discussions-and-proposals).

### Conferences

There are a lot of [React Native Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/topics/react-native/) that happen around the world. Often there is React Native content in React meetups as well. React Native has been covered often in past React Conf talks. Videos for these talks can be found online in the following playlists: [React Conf 2019](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPxbbTqCLbGHPxZpw4xj_Wwg8-fdNxJRh), [React Conf 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXYPpY_mElQ), [React Conf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS3fZ46IGFirdqKTIxlws7e0), [React Conf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY) and [React Conf 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr&v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4).
