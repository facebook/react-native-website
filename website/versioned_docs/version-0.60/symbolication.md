title: Symbolicating a stack trace
---

If a React Native app throws an unhandled exception in a release build, the output may be obfuscated and hard to read:

```sh
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: FATAL EXCEPTION: mqt_native_modules
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: Process: com.awesomeproject, PID: 18979 07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: com.facebook.react.common.JavascriptException: Failed, js engine: hermes, stack:
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: p@1:132161
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: p@1:132084
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: f@1:131854
07-15 10:58:25.820 18979 18998 E AndroidRuntime: anonymous@1:131119
```

The sections like `p@1:132161` are minified function names and bytecode offsets. To debug the problem, you would instead want to translate it into file, line and function name: `AwesomeProject/App.js:54:initializeMap`. This is known as **symbolication.** You can symbolicate minified function names and bytecode like the above by passing `metro-symbolicate` a generated source map and the stack trace.

> The `metro-symbolicate` package is installed by default in the React Native template project from [setting up your development environment](environment-setup).

From a file containing the stacktrace:

```sh
npx metro-symbolicate android/app/build/generated/sourcemaps/react/release/index.android.bundle.map < stacktrace.txt
```

From `adb logcat`directly:

```sh
adb logcat -d | npx metro-symbolicate android/app/build/generated/sourcemaps/react/release/index.android.bundle.map
```

This will turn each minified function name and offset like `p@1:132161` into the actual file- and function name `AwesomeProject/App.js:54:initializeMap`.

## Notes on Sourcemaps

- Multiple source maps may be generated by the build process. Make sure to used the one in the location shown in the examples.
- Make sure that the source map you use corresponds to the exact commit of the crashing app. Small changes in source code can cause large differences in offsets.
- If `metro-symbolicate` exits immediately with success, make sure the input comes from a pipe or redirection and not from a terminal.
