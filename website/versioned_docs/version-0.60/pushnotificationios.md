Handle push notifications for your app, including permission handling and icon badge number.

To get up and running, [configure your notifications with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH26-SW6) and your server-side system.

React Native version equal or higher than 0.60.0:

- Autolinking in 0.60.0 handles the linking for you!

React Native versions lower than 0.60.0:

Add the PushNotificationIOS library to your Podfile: ./ios/Podfile

- CocoaPods:

  - Add the PushNotificationIOS library to your Podfile: ./ios/Podfile

    ```

    ``
    ..
    do
    pp
    ..
    S'
    ...
    ```

- [Manually link](linking-libraries-ios.md#manual-linking) the PushNotificationIOS library:
  - Add the following to your Project: `node_modules/react-native/Libraries/PushNotificationIOS/RCTPushNotification.xcodeproj`
  - Add the following to `Link Binary With Libraries`: `libRCTPushNotification.a`

Finally, to enable support for `notification` and `register` events you need to augment your AppDelegate.

At the top of your `AppDelegate.m`:

`#import <React/RCTPushNotificationManager.h>`

And then in your AppDelegate implementation add the following:

```objectivec
 // Required to register for notifications
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:(UIUserNotificationSettings *)notificationSettings
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
 }
 // Required for the register event.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken];
 }
 // Required for the notification event. You must call the completion handler after handling the remote notification.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
                                                        fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
 {
   [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:completionHandler];
 }
 // Required for the registrationError event.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:(NSError *)error
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:error];
 }
 // Required for the localNotification event.
 - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
 {
  [RCTPushNotificationManager didReceiveLocalNotification:notification];
 }
```

To show notifications while being in the foreground (available starting from iOS 10) add the following lines:

At the top of your `AppDelegate.m`:

`#import <UserNotifications/UserNotifications.h>`

And then in your AppDelegate implementation add the following:

```objectivec
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
  ...
  // Define UNUserNotificationCenter
  UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
  center.delegate = self;

  return YES;
}

//Called when a notification is delivered to a foreground app.
-(void)userNotificationCenter:(UNUserNotificationCenter *)center willPresentNotification:(UNNotification *)notification withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UNNotificationPresentationOptions options))completionHandler
{
  completionHandler(UNAuthorizationOptionSound | UNAuthorizationOptionAlert | UNAuthorizationOptionBadge);
}
```

Then enable Background Modes/Remote notifications to be able to use remote notifications properly. The easiest way to do this is via the project settings. Navigate to Targets -> Your App -> Capabilities -> Background Modes and check Remote notifications. This will automatically enable the required settings.

- `register`: Fired when the user registers for remote notifications. The handler will be invoked with a hex string representing the deviceToken.

---

### `requestPermissions()`

```jsx
PushNotificationIOS.requestPermissions([permissions]);

Requests notification permissions from iOS, prompting the user's dialog box. By default, it will request all notification permissions, but a subset of these can be requested by passing a map of requested permissions. The following permissions are supported:

- `alert`
- `badge`
- `sound`

If a map is provided to the method, only the permissions with truthy values will be requested.

This method returns a promise that will resolve when the user accepts, rejects, or if the permissions were previously rejected. The promise resolves to the current state of the permission.

**Parameters:**

| Name        | Type  | Required | Description            |
| ----------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| permissions | array | No       | alert, badge, or sound |

---

### `abandonPermissions()`

```jsx
PushNotificationIOS.abandonPermissions();
```

Unregister for all remote notifications received via Apple Push Notification service.

You should call this method in rare circumstances only, such as when a new version of the app removes support for all types of remote notifications. Users can temporarily prevent apps from receiving remote notifications through the Notifications section of the Settings app. Apps unregistered through this method can always re-register.

---

### `checkPermissions()`

```jsx
PushNotificationIOS.checkPermissions(callback);
```

See what push permissions are currently enabled.

**Parameters:**

| Name     | Type     | Required | Description |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| callback | function | Yes      | See below.  |

`callback` will be invoked with a `permissions` object:

- `alert` :boolean
- `badge` :boolean
- `sound` :boolean

---

### `getInitialNotification()`

```jsx
PushNotificationIOS.getInitialNotification();
```

This method returns a promise. If the app was launched by a push notification, this promise resolves to an object of type `PushNotificationIOS`. Otherwise, it resolves to `null`.

---

### `constructor()`

```jsx
constructor(nativeNotif);
```

You will never need to instantiate `PushNotificationIOS` yourself. Listening to the `notification` event and invoking `getInitialNotification` is sufficient.

---

### `finish()`

```jsx
finish(fetchResult);
```

This method is available for remote notifications that have been received via: `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:` https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIApplicationDelegate_Protocol/#//apple_ref/occ/intfm/UIApplicationDelegate/application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler:

Call this to execute when the remote notification handling is complete. When calling this block, pass in the fetch result value that best describes the results of your operation. You _must_ call this handler and should do so as soon as possible. For a list of possible values, see `PushNotificationIOS.FetchResult`.

If you do not call this method your background remote notifications could be throttled, to read more about it see the above documentation link.

---

```jsx
getMessage();
```

An alias for `getAlert` to get the notification's main message string

---

### `getSound()`

```jsx
getSound();
```

Gets the sound string from the `aps` object

---

### `getCategory()`

```jsx
getCategory();
```

---

### `getAlert()`

```jsx

---

### `getContentAvailable()`

```

---

### `getBadgeCount()`

getBadgeCount();
```

---

### `getData()`

```

Gets the data object on the notification

---

### `getThreadID()`
