title: DrawerLayoutAndroid
---

React component that wraps the platform `DrawerLayout` (Android only). The Drawer (typically used for navigation) is rendered with `renderNavigationView` and direct children are the main view (where your content goes). The navigation view is initially not visible on the screen, but can be pulled in from the side of the window specified by the `drawerPosition` prop and its width can be set by the `drawerWidth` prop.

## Example

```SnackPlayer name=DrawerLayoutAndroid%20Component%20Example&supportedPlatforms=android
import React, { useRef, useState } from "react";
import { Button, DrawerLayoutAndroid, Text, StyleSheet, View } from "react-native";

const App = () => {
  const drawer = useRef(null);
  const [drawerPosition, setDrawerPosition] = useState("left");
  const changeDrawerPosition = () => {
    if (drawerPosition === "left") {
      setDrawerPosition("right");
    } else {
      setDrawerPosition("left");
    }
  };

  const navigationView = () => (
    <View style={[styles.container, styles.navigationContainer]}>
      <Text style={styles.paragraph}>I'm in the Drawer!</Text>
      <Button
        title="Close drawer"
        onPress={() => drawer.current.closeDrawer()}
      />
    </View>
  );

  return (
    <DrawerLayoutAndroid
      ref={drawer}
      drawerWidth={300}
      drawerPosition={drawerPosition}
      renderNavigationView={navigationView}
    >
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Drawer on the {drawerPosition}!
        </Text>
        <Button
          title="Change Drawer Position"
          onPress={() => changeDrawerPosition()}
        />
        <Text style={styles.paragraph}>
          Swipe from the side or press button below to see it!
        </Text>
        <Button
          title="Open drawer"
          onPress={() => drawer.current.openDrawer()}
        />
      </View>
    </DrawerLayoutAndroid>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: "center",
    justifyContent: "center",
    padding: 16
  },
  navigationContainer: {
    backgroundColor: "#ecf0f1"
  },
  paragraph: {
    padding: 16,
    fontSize: 15,
    textAlign: "center"
  }
});

export default App;
```
