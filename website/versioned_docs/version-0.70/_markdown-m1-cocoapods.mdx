    <summary>Note for Mac M1 users</summary>

Mac M1 architecture is not directly compatible with Cocoapods. If you encounter issues when installing pods, you can solve it by running:

- `sudo arch -x86_64 gem install ffi`
- `arch -x86_64 pod install`

These commands install the `ffi` package, to load dynamically-linked libraries and let you run the `pod install` properly, and runs `pod install` with the proper architecture.
