Upgrading to new versions of React Native will give you access to more APIs, views, developer tools and other goodies. Upgrading requires a small amount of effort, but we try to make it easy for you.

## Expo projects

Upgrading your Expo project to a new version of React Native requires updating the `react-native`, `react`, and `expo` package versions in your `package.json` file. Please refer to [this list](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/#sdk-version) to find out what versions are supported. You will also need to set the correct `sdkVersion` in your `app.json` file.

See the [Upgrading Expo SDK Walkthrough](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/upgrading-expo-sdk-walkthrough) for up-to-date information about upgrading your project.

## React Native projects

Because typical React Native projects are essentially made up of an Android project, an iOS project, and a JavaScript project, upgrading can be rather tricky. Here's what you need to do to upgrade from an older version of React Native.

### Upgrade based on Git

The [React Native CLI](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-cli) comes with `upgrade` command that provides a one-step operation to upgrade the source files with a minimum of conflicts, thanks to the [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/react-native-community/rn-diff-purge) project.

#### 1. Make sure your project uses Git

> This step applies only to projects that don't use Git. Skip it if yours use it.

While your project does not have to be handled by the Git versioning system -- you can use Mercurial, SVN, or nothing -- you will still need to [install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your system in order to use `react-native upgrade`. Git will also need to be available in the `PATH`. If your project doesn't use Git, initialize it and commit:

```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "upgrade RN"
```

After the upgrade is done and conflicts resolved, you can remove the `.git` directory.

#### 2. Run the `upgrade` command

Run the following command to start the process of upgrading to the latest version:

```sh
react-native upgrade
```

You may specify a React Native version by passing an argument, e.g. to upgrade to `0.59.0-rc.0` run:

```sh
react-native upgrade 0.59.0-rc.0
```

The project is upgraded using `git apply` with 3-way merge. That's why it may happen you'll need to resolve some conflicts.

#### 4. Resolve the conflicts

Conflicted files include delimiters which make very clear where the changes come from. For example:

```
13B07F951A680F5B00A75B9A /* Release */ = {
  isa = XCBuildConfiguration;
  buildSettings = {
    ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_APPICON_NAME = AppIcon;
<<<<<<< ours
    CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY = "iPhone Developer";
    FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = (
      "$(inherited)",
      "$(PROJECT_DIR)/HockeySDK.embeddedframework",
      "$(PROJECT_DIR)/HockeySDK-iOS/HockeySDK.embeddedframework",
    );
=======
    CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 1;
>>>>>>> theirs
    HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS = (
      "$(inherited)",
      /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/include,
      "$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/React/**",
      "$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-code-push/ios/CodePush/**",
    );
```

You can think of "ours" as "your team" and "theirs" as "the React Native dev team".

### Alternative

Use this only in case the above didn't work.

#### 1. Upgrade the `react-native` dependency

Note the latest version of the `react-native` npm package [from here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native) (or use `npm info react-native` to check).

Now install that version of `react-native` in your project with `npm install --save`:

```sh
$ npm install --save react-native@X.Y
# where X.Y is the semantic version you are upgrading to
npm WARN peerDependencies The peer dependency react@~R included from react-native...
```

If you saw a warning about the peerDependency, also upgrade `react` by running:

```sh
$ npm install --save react@R
# where R is the new version of react from the peerDependency warning you saw
```

#### 2. Upgrade your project templates

The new npm package may contain updates to the files that are normally generated when you run `react-native init`, like the iOS and the Android sub-projects.

You may consult [rn-diff-purge](https://github.com/pvinis/rn-diff-purge) to see if there were changes in the project template files. In case there weren't any, simply rebuild the project and continue developing. In case of minor changes, you may update your project manually and rebuild.

If there were major changes, run this in a terminal to get these:

```sh
$ react-native upgrade
```

This will check your files against the latest template and perform the following:

* If there is a new file in the template, it is simply created.
* If a file in the template is identical to your file, it is skipped.
* If a file is different in your project than the template, you will be prompted; you have options to keep your file or overwrite it with the template version.

## Manual Upgrades

Some upgrades require manual steps, e.g. 0.28 to 0.29, or 0.56 to 0.57. Be sure to check the [release notes](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases) when upgrading so that you can identify any manual changes your particular project may require.
