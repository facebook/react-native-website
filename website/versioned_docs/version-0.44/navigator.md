`Navigator` has been removed from the core React Native package in version 0.44. The module has been moved to a [`react-native-custom-components`](https://github.com/facebookarchive/react-native-custom-components) package that can be imported by your application in order to maintain backwards compatibility.

To see the original docs for `Navigator`, please switch to an [older version of the docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/0.43/navigator.html).
