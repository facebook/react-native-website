## Props

### `alignContent`

`alignContent` controls how rows align in the cross direction, overriding the `alignContent` of the parent. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-content for more details.

| Type                                                                                 | Required |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| enum('flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'stretch', 'space-between', 'space-around') | No       |

---

### `alignItems`

`alignItems` aligns children in the cross direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `alignItems` controls how they align horizontally. It works like `align-items` in CSS (default: stretch). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items for more details.

| Type                                                            | Required |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'stretch', 'baseline') | No       |

---

### `alignSelf`

`alignSelf` controls how a child aligns in the cross direction, overriding the `alignItems` of the parent. It works like `align-self` in CSS (default: auto). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-self for more details.

| Type                                                                    | Required |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('auto', 'flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'stretch', 'baseline') | No       |

---

### `aspectRatio`

Aspect ratio controls the size of the undefined dimension of a node. Aspect ratio is a non-standard property only available in React Native and not CSS.

- On a node with a set width/height aspect ratio controls the size of the unset dimension
- On a node with a set flex basis aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset
- On a node with a measure function aspect ratio works as though the measure function measures the flex basis
- On a node with flex grow/shrink aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset
- Aspect ratio takes min/max dimensions into account

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

### `bottom`

`bottom` is the number of logical pixels to offset the bottom edge of this component.

It works similarly to `bottom` in CSS, but in React Native you must use points or percentages. Ems and other units are not supported.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom for more details of how `bottom` affects layout.

| Type           | Required |
| -------------- | -------- |
| number, string | No       |

---

### `direction`

`direction` specifies the directional flow of the user interface. The default is `inherit`, except for root node which will have value based on the current locale. See https://yogalayout.com/docs/layout-direction for more details.

| Type                          | Required | Platform |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| enum('inherit', 'ltr', 'rtl') | No       | iOS      |

---

### `display`

`display` sets the display type of this component.

It works similarly to `display` in CSS, but only support 'flex' and 'none'. 'flex' is the default.

| Type                 | Required |
| -------------------- | -------- |
| enum('none', 'flex') | No       |

---

### `end`

When the direction is `ltr`, `end` is equivalent to `right`. When the direction is `rtl`, `end` is equivalent to `left`.

| Type           | Required |
| -------------- | -------- |
| number, string | No       |

---

### `flex`

In React Native `flex` does not work the same way that it does in CSS. `flex` is a number rather than a string, and it works according to the [Yoga](https://github.com/facebook/yoga).

When `flex` is a positive number, it makes the component flexible and it will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with `flex` set to 2 will take twice the space as a component with `flex` set to 1. `flex: <positive number>` equates to `flexGrow: <positive number>, flexShrink: 1, flexBasis: 0`.

When `flex` is 0, the component is sized according to `width` and `height` and it is inflexible.

When `flex` is -1, the component is normally sized according `width` and `height`. However, if there's not enough space, the component will shrink to its `minWidth` and `minHeight`.

flexGrow, flexShrink, and flexBasis work the same as in CSS.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `flexBasis`

---

### `flexDirection`

`flexDirection` controls which directions children of a container go. `row` goes left to right, `column` goes top to bottom, and you may be able to guess what the other two do. It works like `flex-direction` in CSS, except the default is `column`. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction for more details.

| Type                                                   | Required |

`flexWrap` controls whether children can wrap around after they hit the end of a flex container. It works like `flex-wrap` in CSS (default: nowrap). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap for more details. Note it does not work anymore with `alignItems: stretch` (the default), so you may want to use `alignItems: flex-start` for example (breaking change details: https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.28.0).

| -------------- | -------- |
| number, string | No       |

---

### `justifyContent`

It works like `justify-content` in CSS (default: flex-start). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content for more details.

| Type                                                                                      | Required |

It works like `overflow` in CSS (default: visible). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/overflow for more details.

| Type                                | Required |

### `position`

`position` in React Native is similar to regular CSS, but everything is set to `relative` by default, so `absolute` positioning is always relative to the parent.

If you want to position a child using specific numbers of logical pixels relative to its parent, set the child to have `absolute` position.

If you want to position a child relative to something that is not its parent, don't use styles for that. Use the component tree.

See https://github.com/facebook/yoga for more details on how `position` differs between React Native and CSS.

| Type                         | Required |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right for more details of how `right` affects layout.

| Type           | Required |
| -------------- | -------- |
| number, string | No       |

---

### `start`

When the direction is `ltr`, `start` is equivalent to `left`. When the direction is `rtl`, `start` is equivalent to `right`.

This style takes precedence over the `left`, `right`, and `end` styles.

| Type           | Required |
| -------------- | -------- |
| number, string | No       |

---

### `top`

`top` is the number of logical pixels to offset the top edge of this component.

---

### `zIndex`

`zIndex` controls which components display on top of others. Normally, you don't use `zIndex`. Components render according to their order in the document tree, so later components draw over earlier ones. `zIndex` may be useful if you have animations or custom modal interfaces where you don't want this behavior.

It works like the CSS `z-index` property - components with a larger `zIndex` will render on top. Think of the z-direction like it's pointing from the phone into your eyeball. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index for more details.

On iOS, `zIndex` may require `View`s to be siblings of each other for it to work as expected.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |
