id: scrollview
title: ScrollView
---

Component that wraps platform ScrollView while providing integration with touch locking "responder" system.

Keep in mind that ScrollViews must have a bounded height in order to work, since they contain unbounded-height children into a bounded container (via a scroll interaction). In order to bound the height of a ScrollView, either set the height of the view directly (discouraged) or make sure all parent views have bounded height. Forgetting to transfer `{flex: 1}` down the view stack can lead to errors here, which the element inspector makes quick to debug.

Doesn't yet support other contained responders from blocking this scroll view from becoming the responder.

`<ScrollView>` vs [`<FlatList>`](flatlist.md) - which one to use?

`ScrollView` renders all its react child components at once, but this has a performance downside.

Imagine you have a very long list of items you want to display, maybe several screens worth of content. Creating JS components and native views for everything all at once, much of which may not even be shown, will contribute to slow rendering and increased memory usage.

This is where `FlatList` comes into play. `FlatList` renders items lazily, when they are about to appear, and removes items that scroll way off screen to save memory and processing time.

`FlatList` is also handy if you want to render separators between your items, multiple columns, infinite scroll loading, or any number of other features it supports out of the box.

### Example

```SnackPlayer name=ScrollView
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, SafeAreaView, ScrollView } from 'react-native';
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <ScrollView style={styles.scrollView}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>
          Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do

        </Text>
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    marginTop: Constants.statusBarHeight,
  },
  scrollView: {
    backgroundColor: 'pink',
    marginHorizontal: 20,
  },
  text: {
    fontSize: 42,
  },
});
```

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---

### `contentContainerStyle`

These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which wraps all of the child views. Example:

```
return (
  <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
  </ScrollView>
);
...
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  contentContainer: {
    paddingVertical: 20
  }
});
```

| Type                                 | Required |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| StyleSheetPropType(View Style props) | No       |

---

### `contentInset`

The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view. Defaults to `{top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0}`.

| Type                                                               | Required | Platform |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| object: {top: number, left: number, bottom: number, right: number} | No       | iOS      |

---

### `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`

This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view. The default value of this property is "never". Available on iOS 11 and later.

| Type                                                   | Required | Platform |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| enum('automatic', 'scrollableAxes', 'never', 'always') | No       | iOS      |

---

### `contentOffset`

Used to manually set the starting scroll offset. The default value is `{x: 0, y: 0}`.

| Type          | Required | Platform |
| ------------- | -------- | -------- |
| PointPropType | No       | iOS      |

---

### `decelerationRate`

A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view decelerates after the user lifts their finger. You may also use string shortcuts `"normal"` and `"fast"` which match the underlying iOS settings for `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal` and `UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast` respectively.

- `'normal'` (the default), 0.998 on iOS, 0.985 on Android.
- `'fast'`, 0.99 on iOS, 0.9 on Android.

| Type                            | Required |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('fast', 'normal'), ,number | No       |

---

### `directionalLockEnabled`

When true, the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal scrolling while dragging. The default value is false.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---

### `disableIntervalMomentum`

When true, the scroll view stops on the next index (in relation to scroll position at release) regardless of how fast the gesture is. This can be used for horizontal pagination when the page is less than the width of the ScrollView. The default value is false.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `disableScrollViewPanResponder`

When true, the default JS pan responder on the ScrollView is disabled, and full control over touches inside the ScrollView is left to its child components. This is particularly useful if `snapToInterval` is enabled, since it does not follow typical touch patterns. Do not use this on regular ScrollView use cases without `snapToInterval` as it may cause unexpected touches to occur while scrolling. The default value is false.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `endFillColor`

Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills. When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not needed in the general case.

| Type               | Required | Platform |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| [color](colors.md) | No       | Android  |

---

### `horizontal`

When true, the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `indicatorStyle`

The style of the scroll indicators.

- `'default'` (the default), same as `black`.
- `'black'`, scroll indicator is `black`. This style is good against a light background.
- `'white'`, scroll indicator is `white`. This style is good against a dark background.

| Type                              | Required | Platform |
| --------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| enum('default', 'black', 'white') | No       | iOS      |

---

### `invertStickyHeaders`

If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `keyboardDismissMode`

Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.

_Cross platform_

- `'none'` (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
- `'on-drag'`, the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.

_iOS Only_

- `'interactive'`, the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the dismissal. On android this is not supported and it will have the same behavior as 'none'.

| Type                                   | Required |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('none', 'on-drag', 'interactive') | No       |

---

### `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`

Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.

- `'never'` (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
- `'always'`, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
- `'handled'`, the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by children of the scroll view (or captured by an ancestor).
- `false`, **_deprecated_**, use 'never' instead
- `true`, **_deprecated_**, use 'always' instead

| Type                                            | Required |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('always', 'never', 'handled', false, true) | No       |

---

### `maintainVisibleContentPosition`

When set, the scroll view will adjust the scroll position so that the first child that is currently visible and at or beyond `minIndexForVisible` will not change position. This is useful for lists that are loading content in both directions, e.g. a chat thread, where new messages coming in might otherwise cause the scroll position to jump. A value of 0 is common, but other values such as 1 can be used to skip loading spinners or other content that should not maintain position.

The optional `autoscrollToTopThreshold` can be used to make the content automatically scroll to the top after making the adjustment if the user was within the threshold of the top before the adjustment was made. This is also useful for chat-like applications where you want to see new messages scroll into place, but not if the user has scrolled up a ways and it would be disruptive to scroll a bunch.

Caveat 1: Reordering elements in the scrollview with this enabled will probably cause jumpiness and jank. It can be fixed, but there are currently no plans to do so. For now, don't re-order the content of any ScrollViews or Lists that use this feature.

Caveat 2: This uses `contentOffset` and `frame.origin` in native code to compute visibility. Occlusion, transforms, and other complexity won't be taken into account as to whether content is "visible" or not.

| Type                                                                     | Required | Platform |

| function | No       |

---

### `onScroll`

Fires at most once per frame during scrolling. The frequency of the events can be controlled using the `scrollEventThrottle` prop. The event has the shape `{ nativeEvent: { contentInset: { bottom, left, right, top }, contentOffset: { x, y }, contentSize: { height, width }, layoutMeasurement: { height, width }, zoomScale } }`. All values are numbers.

| Type     | Required |

Fires when the scroll view scrolls to top after the status bar has been tapped.

| Type     | Required | Platform |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| function | No       | iOS      |

---

### `overScrollMode`

Used to override default value of overScroll mode.

Possible values:

- `'auto'` - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
- `'always'` - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
- `'never'` - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.

| Type                            | Required | Platform |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| enum('auto', 'always', 'never') | No       | Android  |

---

### `pagingEnabled`

When true, the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default value is false.

Note: Vertical pagination is not supported on Android.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `persistentScrollbar`

Causes the scrollbars not to turn transparent when they are not in use. The default value is false.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | Android  |

---

### `pinchGestureEnabled`

When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out. The default value is true.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---

### `refreshControl`

A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh functionality for the ScrollView. Only works for vertical ScrollViews (`horizontal` prop must be `false`).

See [RefreshControl](refreshcontrol.md).

| Type    | Required |
| ------- | -------- |
| element | No       |

---

### `removeClippedSubviews`

Experimental: When true, offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen. This can improve scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is true.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `scrollEnabled`

When false, the view cannot be scrolled via touch interaction. The default value is true.

Note that the view can always be scrolled by calling `scrollTo`.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `scrollEventThrottle`

This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (as a time interval in ms). A lower number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position, but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge. You will not notice a difference between values set between 1-16 as the JS run loop is synced to the screen refresh rate. If you do not need precise scroll position tracking, set this value higher to limit the information being sent across the bridge. The default value is zero, which results in the scroll event being sent only once each time the view is scrolled.

| Type   | Required | Platform |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| number | No       | iOS      |

---

### `scrollIndicatorInsets`

The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view. This should normally be set to the same value as the `contentInset`. Defaults to `{0, 0, 0, 0}`.

| Type                                                               | Required | Platform |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| object: {top: number, left: number, bottom: number, right: number} | No       | iOS      |

---

### `scrollPerfTag`

Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native FpsListener for it to be useful.

| Type   | Required | Platform |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| string | No       | Android  |

---

### `scrollToOverflowEnabled`

When true, the scroll view can be programmatically scrolled beyond its content size. The default value is false.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---

### `scrollsToTop`

When true, the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped. The default value is true.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---

### `DEPRECATED_sendUpdatedChildFrames`

When true, ScrollView will emit updateChildFrames data in scroll events, otherwise will not compute or emit child frame data. This only exists to support legacy issues, `onLayout` should be used instead to retrieve frame data. The default value is false.

| Type | Required | Platform |
| ---- | -------- | -------- |
| bool | No       | iOS      |

---

### `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`

When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator. The default value is true.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`

When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator. The default value is true.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `snapToAlignment`

When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the snapping to the scroll view.

- `'start'` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical).
- `'center'` will align the snap in the center.
- `'end'` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical).

| Type                           | Required | Platform |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | -------- |
| enum('start', 'center', 'end') | No       | iOS      |

---

### `snapToEnd`

Use in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.

| Type    | Required |
| ------- | -------- |
| boolean | No       |

---

### `snapToInterval`

When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`. This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Typically used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `snapToOffsets`

When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view. Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| array of number | No       |

---

### `snapToStart`

Use in conjunction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.

| Type    | Required |
| ------- | -------- |
| boolean | No       |

---

### `stickyHeaderIndices`

An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`.

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| array of number | No       |

---

### `zoomScale`

The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

| Type   | Required | Platform |
| ------ | -------- | -------- |
| number | No       | iOS      |

## Methods

### `flashScrollIndicators()`

```jsx
flashScrollIndicators();
```

Displays the scroll indicators momentarily.

---

### `scrollTo()`

```jsx
scrollTo(
  options?: {x?: number, y?: number, animated?: boolean} | number,
  deprecatedX?: number,
	deprecatedAnimated?: boolean,
);
```

Scrolls to a given x, y offset, either immediately, with a smooth animation.

Example:

`scrollTo({x: 0, y: 0, animated: true})`

Note: The weird function signature is due to the fact that, for historical reasons, the function also accepts separate arguments as an alternative to the options object. This is deprecated due to ambiguity (y before x), and SHOULD NOT BE USED.

---

### `scrollToEnd()`

```jsx
scrollToEnd(([options]: { animated: boolean }));
```

If this is a vertical ScrollView scrolls to the bottom. If this is a horizontal ScrollView scrolls to the right.

Use `scrollToEnd({animated: true})` for smooth animated scrolling, `scrollToEnd({animated: false})` for immediate scrolling. If no options are passed, `animated` defaults to true.

---

### `scrollWithoutAnimationTo()`

```jsx
scrollWithoutAnimationTo(y, x);
```

Deprecated, use `scrollTo` instead.
