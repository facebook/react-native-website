> If you're looking for a more extensive and future-proof way to handle touch-based input, check out the [Pressable](pressable.md) API.

Do not use unless you have a very good reason. All elements that respond to press should have a visual feedback when touched.

`TouchableWithoutFeedback` supports only one child. If you wish to have several child components, wrap them in a View. Importantly, `TouchableWithoutFeedback` works by cloning its child and applying responder props to it. It is therefore required that any intermediary components pass through those props to the underlying React Native component.

## Usage Pattern

```jsx
function MyComponent(props) {
  return (
    <View {...props} style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: '#fff' }}>
      <Text>My Component</Text>
    </View>
  );
}

<TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={() => alert('Pressed!')}>
  <MyComponent />
</TouchableWithoutFeedback>;
```

## Example

```SnackPlayer name=TouchableWithoutFeedback
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { StyleSheet, TouchableWithoutFeedback, Text, View } from "react-native";

const TouchableWithoutFeedbackExample = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const onPress = () => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={styles.countContainer}>
        <Text style={styles.countText}>Count: {count}</Text>
      </View>
      <TouchableWithoutFeedback onPress={onPress}>
        <View style={styles.button}>
          <Text>Touch Here</Text>
        </View>
      </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    paddingHorizontal: 10
  },
  button: {
    alignItems: "center",
    backgroundColor: "#DDDDDD",
    padding: 10
  },
  countContainer: {
    alignItems: "center",
    padding: 10
  },
  countText: {
    color: "#FF00FF"
  }
});

export default TouchableWithoutFeedbackExample;
```

| object: {disabled: bool, selected: bool, checked: bool or 'mixed', busy: bool, expanded: bool} | No       |

---

### `accessibilityActions`

Accessibility actions allow an assistive technology to programmatically invoke the actions of a component. The `accessibilityActions` property should contain a list of action objects. Each action object should contain the field name and label.

See the [Accessibility guide](accessibility.md#accessibility-actions) for more information.

| Type  | Required |
| ----- | -------- |
| array | No       |

### `onAccessibilityAction`

---

### `hitSlop`

This defines how far your touch can start away from the button. This is added to `pressRetentionOffset` when moving off of the button.

> The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits two overlapping views.

| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `onPressOut`

---

### `pressRetentionOffset`

When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far your touch may move off of the button, before deactivating the button.
