[Hermes](https://hermesengine.dev) is an open-source JavaScript engine optimized for React Native. For many apps, using Hermes will result in improved start-up time, decreased memory usage, and smaller app size when compared to JavaScriptCore.
Hermes is used by default by React Native and no additional configuration is required to enable it.

## Bundled Hermes

React Native comes with a **bundled version** of Hermes.
We building a version of Hermes for you whenever we release a new version of React Native. This will make sure you're consuming a version of Hermes which is fully compatible with the version of React Native you're using.

This change is fully transparent to users of React Native. You can still disable Hermes using the command described in this page.
You can [read more about the technical implementation on this page](/architecture/bundled-hermes).

## Confirming Hermes is in use

If you've recently created a new app from scratch, you should see if Hermes is enabled in the welcome view:

A `HermesInternal` global variable will be available in JavaScript that can be used to verify that Hermes is in use:

```jsx
const isHermes = () => !!global.HermesInternal;
```

:::caution
If you are using a non-standard way of loading the JS bundle, it is possible that the `HermesInternal` variable is available but you aren't using the highly optimised pre-compiled bytecode.
Confirm that you are using the `.hbc` file and also benchmark the before/after as detailed below.
:::

To see the benefits of Hermes, try making a release build/deployment of your app to compare. For example; from the root of your project:

<Tabs groupId="platform" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultPlatform} values={constants.platforms} className="pill-tabs">
<TabItem value="android">

[//]: # 'Android'

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultPackageManager} values={constants.packageManagers}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm run android -- --mode="release"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn android --mode release
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="ios">

[//]: # 'iOS'

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultPackageManager} values={constants.packageManagers}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm run ios -- --mode="Release"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn ios --mode Release
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will compile JavaScript to Hermes Bytecode during build time which will improve your app's startup speed on device.

## Switching back to JavaScriptCore

React Native also supports using JavaScriptCore as the [JavaScript engine](javascript-environment). Follow these instructions to opt-out of Hermes.

### Android

Edit your `android/gradle.properties` file and flip `hermesEnabled` back to false:

```diff
# Use this property to enable or disable the Hermes JS engine.
# If set to false, you will be using JSC instead.
hermesEnabled=false
```

### iOS

Edit your `ios/Podfile` file and make the change illustrated below:

```diff
   use_react_native!(
     :path => config[:reactNativePath],
+    :hermes_enabled => false,
     # An absolute path to your application root.
     :app_path => "#{Pod::Config.instance.installation_root}/.."
   )
```
