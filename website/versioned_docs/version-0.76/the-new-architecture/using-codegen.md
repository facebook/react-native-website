# Using Codegen

This guide teaches how to:

- Configure **Codegen**.
- Invoke it manually for each platform.

It also describes the generated code.

## Prerequisites

You always need a React Native app to generate the code properly, even when invoking the **Codegen** manually.

The **Codegen** process is tightly coupled with the build of the app, and the scripts are located in the `react-native` NPM package.

For the sake of this guide, create a project using the React Native CLI as follows:

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init SampleApp --version 0.76.0
```

**Codegen** is used to generate the glue-code for your custom modules or components. See the guides for Turbo Native Modules and Fabric Native Components for more details on how to create them.

<!-- TODO: add links -->

## Configuring **Codegen**

**Codegen** can be configured in your app by modifying the `package.json` file. **Codegen** is controlled by a custom field called `codegenConfig`.

```json title="package.json"
  "codegenConfig": {
    "name": "<SpecName>",
    "type": "<types>",
    "jsSrcsDir": "<source_dir>",
    "android": {
      "javaPackageName": "<java.package.name>"
    },
    "ios": {
      "modulesConformingToProtocol": {
        "RCTImageURLLoader": [
          "<iOS-module-conforming-to-RCTImageURLLoader>",
        ],
        "RCTImageDataDecoder": [
          "<iOS-module-conforming-to-RCTImageDataDecoder>",
        ],
        "RCTURLRequestHandler": [
          "<iOS-module-conforming-to-RCTURLRequestHandler>",
        ]
      }
    }
  },
```

You can add this snippet to your app and customize the various fields:

- `name:` This is the name that will be used to create files containing your specs. As a convention, It should have the suffix `Spec`, but this is not mandatory.
- `type`: the type of code we need to generate. Allowed values are `modules`, `components`, `all`.
  - `modules:` use this value if you only need to generate code for Turbo Native Modules.
  - `components:` use this value if you only need to generate code for Native Fabric Components.
  - `all`: use this value if you have a mixture of components and modules.
- `jsSrcsDir`: this is the root folder where all your specs live.
- `android.javaPackageName`: this is an Android specific setting to let **Codegen** generate the files in a custom package.
- `ios`: the `ios` field is an object that can be used by app developers and library maintainers to provide some advanced functionalities. All the following fields are **optional**.
  - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol`: React Native offers some protocols that native modules can implement to customize some behaviors. This fields allow to define the list of modules that conforms to those protocols. These modules will be injected in the React Native runtime when the app starts.
    - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol.RCTImageURLLoader`: list of iOS native modules that implements the [`RCTImageURLLoader` protocol](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/00d5caee9921b6c10be8f7d5b3903c6afe8dbefa/packages/react-native/Libraries/Image/RCTImageURLLoader.h#L26-L81).
    - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol.RCTImageDataDecoder`: list of iOS native modules that implements the [`RCTImageDataDecoder` protocol](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/00d5caee9921b6c10be8f7d5b3903c6afe8dbefa/packages/react-native/Libraries/Image/RCTImageDataDecoder.h#L15-L53).
    - `ios.modulesConformingToProtocol.RCTURLRequestHandler`: list of iOS native modules that implements the [`RCTURLRequestHandler` protocol](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/00d5caee9921b6c10be8f7d5b3903c6afe8dbefa/packages/react-native/React/Base/RCTURLRequestHandler.h#L11-L52).

When **Codegen** runs, it searches among all the dependencies of the app, looking for JS files that respects some specific conventions, and it generates the required code:

- Turbo Native Modules require that the spec files are prefixed with `Native`. For example, `NativeLocalStorage.ts` is a valid name for a spec file.
- Native Fabric Components require that the spec files are suffixed with `NativeComponent`. For example, `WebViewNativeComponent.ts` is a valid name for a spec file.

## Running **Codegen**

The rest of this guide assumes that you have a Native Turbo Module, a Native Fabric Component or both already set up in your project. We also assume that you have valid specification files in the `jsSrcsDir` specified in the `package.json`.

### Android

**Codegen** for Android is integrated with the React Native Gradle Plugin (RNGP). The RNGP contains a task that can be invoked that reads the configurations defined in the `package.json` file and execute **Codegen**. To run the gradle task, first navigate inside the `android `folder of your project. Then run:

```bash
./gradlew generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema
```

This task invokes the `generateCodegenArtifactsFromSchema` command on all the imported projects of the app (the app and all the node modules which are linked to it). It generates the code in the corresponding `node_modules/<dependency>` folder. For example, if you have a Fabric Native Component whose Node module is called `my-fabric-component`, the generated code is located in the `SampleApp/node_modules/my-fabric-component/android/build/generated/source/codegen` path. For the app, the code is generated in the `android/app/build/generated/source/codegen` folder.

#### The Generated Code

After running the gradle command above, you will find the codegen code in the `SampleApp/android/app/build` folder. The structure will look like this:

```
build
└── generated
    └── source
        └── codegen
            ├── java
            │   └── com
            │       ├── facebook
            │       │   └── react
            │       │       └── viewmanagers
            │       │           ├── <nativeComponent>ManagerDelegate.java
            │       │           └── <nativeComponent>ManagerInterface.java
            │       └── sampleapp
            │           └── NativeLocalStorageSpec.java
            ├── jni
            │   ├── <codegenConfig.name>-generated.cpp
            │   ├── <codegenConfig.name>.h
            │   ├── CMakeLists.txt
            │   └── react
            │       └── renderer
            │           └── components
            │               └── <codegenConfig.name>
            │                   ├── <codegenConfig.name>JSI-generated.cpp
            │                   ├── <codegenConfig.name>.h
            │                   ├── ComponentDescriptors.cpp
            │                   ├── ComponentDescriptors.h
            │                   ├── EventEmitters.cpp
            │                   ├── EventEmitters.h
            │                   ├── Props.cpp
            │                   ├── Props.h
            │                   ├── ShadowNodes.cpp
            │                   ├── ShadowNodes.h
            │                   ├── States.cpp
            │                   └── States.h
            └── schema.json
```

The generated code is split in two folders:

- `java` which contains the platform specific code
- `jni` which contains the C++ code required to let JS and Java interact correctly.

In the `java` folder, you can find the Fabric Native component generated code in the `com/facebook/viewmanagers` subfolder.

- the `<nativeComponent>ManagerDelegate.java` contains the methods that the `ViewManager` can call on the custom Native Component
- the `<nativeComponent>ManagerInterface.java` contains the interface of the `ViewManager`.

In the folder whose name was set up in the `codegenConfig.android.javaPackageName`, instead, you can find the abstract class that a Turbo Native Module has to implement to carry out its tasks.

In the `jni` folder, finally, there is all the boilerplate code to connect JS to Android.

- `<codegenConfig.name>.h` this contains the interface of your custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>-generated.cpp` this contains the glue code of your custom custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `react/renderer/components/<codegenConfig.name>`: this folder contains all the glue-code required by your custom component.

This structure has been generated by using the value `all` for the `codegenConfig.type` field. If you use the value `modules`, expect to see no `react/renderer/components/` folder. If you use the value `components`, expect not to see any of the other files.

### iOS

**Codegen** for iOS relies on some Node scripts that are invoked during the build process. The scripts are located in the `SampleApp/node_modules/react-native/scripts/` folder.

The main script is the `generate-codegen-artifacts.js` script. To invoke the script, you can run this command from the root folder of your app:

```bash
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/generate-codegen-artifacts.js

Usage: generate-codegen-artifacts.js -p [path to app] -t [target platform] -o [output path]

Options:
      --help            Show help                                      [boolean]
      --version         Show version number                            [boolean]
  -p, --path            Path to the React Native project root.        [required]
  -t, --targetPlatform  Target platform. Supported values: "android", "ios",
                        "all".                                        [required]
  -o, --outputPath      Path where generated artifacts will be output to.
```

where:

- `--path` is the path to the root folder of your app.
- `--outputPath` is the destination where **Codegen** will write the generated files.
- `--targetPlatform` is the platform you'd like to generate the code for.

#### The Generated Code

Running the script with these arguments:

```shell
node node_modules/react-native/scripts/generate-codegen-artifacts.js \
    --path . \
    --outputPath ios/ \
    --targetPlatform ios
```

Will generate these files in the `ios/build` folder:

```
build
└── generated
    └── ios
        ├── <codegenConfig.name>
        │   ├── <codegenConfig.name>-generated.mm
        │   └── <codegenConfig.name>.h
        ├── <codegenConfig.name>JSI-generated.cpp
        ├── <codegenConfig.name>JSI.h
        ├── FBReactNativeSpec
        │   ├── FBReactNativeSpec-generated.mm
        │   └── FBReactNativeSpec.h
        ├── FBReactNativeSpecJSI-generated.cpp
        ├── FBReactNativeSpecJSI.h
        ├── RCTModulesConformingToProtocolsProvider.h
        ├── RCTModulesConformingToProtocolsProvider.mm
        └── react
            └── renderer
                └── components
                    └── <codegenConfig.name>
                        ├── ComponentDescriptors.cpp
                        ├── ComponentDescriptors.h
                        ├── EventEmitters.cpp
                        ├── EventEmitters.h
                        ├── Props.cpp
                        ├── Props.h
                        ├── RCTComponentViewHelpers.h
                        ├── ShadowNodes.cpp
                        ├── ShadowNodes.h
                        ├── States.cpp
                        └── States.h
```

Part of these generated files are used by React Native in the Core. Then there is a set of files which contains the same name you specified in the package.json `codegenConfig.name` field.

- `<codegenConfig.name>/<codegenConfig.name>.h`: this contains the interface of your custom iOS Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>/<codegenConfig.name>-generated.mm`: this contains the glue code of your custom iOS Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>JSI.h`: this contains the interface of your custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `<codegenConfig.name>JSI-generated.h`: this contains the glue code of your custom custom C++ Turbo Native Modules.
- `react/renderer/components/<codegenConfig.name>`: this folder contains all the glue-code required by your custom component.

This structure has been generated by using the value `all` for the `codegenConfig.type` field. If you use the value `modules`, expect to see no `react/renderer/components/` folder. If you use the value `components`, expect not to see any of the other files.
