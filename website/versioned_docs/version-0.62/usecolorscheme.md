```jsx
import { useColorScheme } from 'react-native';
```

The `useColorScheme` React hook provides and subscribes to color scheme updates from the [`Appearance`](appearance) module. The return value indicates the current user preferred color scheme. The value may be updated later, either through direct user action (e.g. theme selection in device settings) or on a schedule (e.g. light and dark themes that follow the day/night cycle).

Supported color schemes:

- `light`: The user prefers a light color theme.
- `dark`: The user prefers a dark color theme.
- null: The user has not indicated a preferred color theme.

```jsx
import { Text, useColorScheme } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  return <Text>useColorScheme(): {colorScheme}</Text>;
};
```

You can find a complete example that demonstrates the use of this hook alongside a React context to add support for light and dark themes to your application in [`AppearanceExample.js`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/packages/rn-tester/js/examples/Appearance/AppearanceExample.js).
