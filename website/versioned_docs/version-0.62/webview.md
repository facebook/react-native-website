title: 'ðŸš§ WebView'

> **Deprecated.** Use [react-native-community/react-native-webview](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-webview) instead.

`WebView` renders web content in a native view.

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { WebView } from 'react-native';

class MyWeb extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <WebView
        source={{
          uri: 'https://github.com/facebook/react-native'
        }}
        style={{ marginTop: 20 }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

Minimal example with inline HTML:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { WebView } from 'react-native';

class MyInlineWeb extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <WebView
        originWhitelist={['*']}
        source={{ html: '<h1>Hello world</h1>' }}
      />
    );
  }
}
```

You can use this component to navigate back and forth in the web view's history and configure various properties for the web content.

On iOS, the `useWebKit` prop can be used to opt into a WKWebView-backed implementation.

> **Security Warning:** Currently, `onMessage` and `postMessage` do not allow specifying an origin. This can lead to cross-site scripting attacks if an unexpected document is loaded within a `WebView` instance. Please refer to the MDN documentation for [`Window.postMessage()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) for more details on the security implications of this.

# Reference

## Props

Inherits [View Props](view.md#props).

---

### `source`

Loads static HTML or a URI (with optional headers) in the WebView. Note that static HTML will require setting [`originWhitelist`](webview#originwhitelist) to `["*"]`.

The object passed to `source` can have either of the following shapes:

**Load uri**

- `uri` (string) - The URI to load in the `WebView`. Can be a local or remote file.
- `method` (string) - The HTTP Method to use. Defaults to GET if not specified. On Android, the only supported methods are GET and POST.
- `headers` (object) - Additional HTTP headers to send with the request. On Android, this can only be used with GET requests.
- `body` (string) - The HTTP body to send with the request. This must be a valid UTF-8 string, and will be sent exactly as specified, with no additional encoding (e.g. URL-escaping or base64) applied. On Android, this can only be used with POST requests.

**Static HTML**

- `html` (string) - A static HTML page to display in the WebView.
- `baseUrl` (string) - The base URL to be used for any relative links in the HTML.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| object | No       |

---

### `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`

Controls whether to adjust the content inset for web views that are placed behind a navigation bar, tab bar, or toolbar. The default value is `true`.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `injectJavaScript`

Function that accepts a string that will be passed to the WebView and executed immediately as JavaScript.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

---

### `injectedJavaScript`

Set this to provide JavaScript that will be injected into the web page when the view loads.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| string | No       |

---

### `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction`

Boolean that determines whether HTML5 audio and video requires the user to tap them before they start playing. The default value is `true`.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |

---

### `nativeConfig`

Override the native component used to render the WebView. Enables a custom native WebView which uses the same JavaScript as the original WebView.

The `nativeConfig` prop expects an object with the following keys:

- `component` (any)
- `props` (object)
- `viewManager` (object)

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| object | No       |

---

### `onError`

Function that is invoked when the `WebView` load fails.

| Type     | Required |

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| function | No       |

### `onMessage`

A function that is invoked when the webview calls `window.postMessage`. Setting this property will inject a `postMessage` global into your webview, but will still call pre-existing values of `postMessage`.

`window.postMessage` accepts one argument, `data`, which will be available on the event object, `event.nativeEvent.data`. `data` must be a string.

| Type     | Required |

---

### `originWhitelist`

List of origin strings to allow being navigated to. The strings allow wildcards and get matched against _only_ the origin (not the full URL). If the user taps to navigate to a new page but the new page is not in this safelist, the URL will be handled by the OS. The default safelistlisted origins are `"http://*"` and `"https://*"`.

| ---- | -------- |
| bool | No       |
