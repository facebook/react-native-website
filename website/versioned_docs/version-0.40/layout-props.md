# Reference

## Props

### `marginLeft`

`marginLeft` works like `margin-left` in CSS. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/margin-left for more details.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `alignItems`

`alignItems` aligns children in the cross direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `alignItems` controls how they align horizontally. It works like `align-items` in CSS (default: stretch). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items for more details.

| Type                                                | Required |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'stretch') | No       |

---

### `aspectRatio`

Aspect ratio control the size of the undefined dimension of a node. Aspect ratio is a non-standard property only available in react native and not CSS.

- On a node with a set width/height aspect ratio control the size of the unset dimension
- On a node with a set flex basis aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset
- On a node with a measure function aspect ratio works as though the measure function measures the flex basis
- On a node with flex grow/shrink aspect ratio controls the size of the node in the cross axis if unset
- Aspect ratio takes min/max dimensions into account

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `borderBottomWidth`

`borderBottomWidth` works like `border-bottom-width` in CSS. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-bottom-width for more details.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `borderLeftWidth`

`borderLeftWidth` works like `border-left-width` in CSS. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-left-width for more details.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `borderRightWidth`

`borderRightWidth` works like `border-right-width` in CSS. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-right-width for more details.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `borderTopWidth`

`borderTopWidth` works like `border-top-width` in CSS. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-top-width for more details.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `borderWidth`

`borderWidth` works like `border-width` in CSS. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width for more details.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `bottom`

`bottom` is the number of logical pixels to offset the bottom edge of this component.

It works similarly to `bottom` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom for more details of how `bottom` affects layout.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `flex`

In React Native `flex` does not work the same way that it does in CSS. `flex` is a number rather than a string, and it works according to the `css-layout` library at https://github.com/facebook/css-layout.

When `flex` is a positive number, it makes the component flexible and it will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with `flex` set to 2 will take twice the space as a component with `flex` set to 1.

When `flex` is 0, the component is sized according to `width` and `height` and it is inflexible.

When `flex` is -1, the component is normally sized according `width` and `height`. However, if there's not enough space, the component will shrink to its `minWidth` and `minHeight`.

flexGrow, flexShrink, and flexBasis work the same as in CSS.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `flexBasis`

| Type   | Required |

| number | No       |

---

| Type                                                   | Required |

| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

It works like `justify-content` in CSS (default: flex-start). See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content for more details.

| Type                                                                      | Required |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'space-between', 'space-around') | No       |

| Type                                                        | Required |

Setting `paddingVertical` is like setting both of `paddingTop` and `paddingBottom`.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `position`

`position` in React Native is similar to regular CSS, but everything is set to `relative` by default, so `absolute` positioning is always just relative to the parent.

If you want to position a child using specific numbers of logical pixels relative to its parent, set the child to have `absolute` position.

If you want to position a child relative to something that is not its parent, just don't use styles for that. Use the component tree.

See https://github.com/facebook/css-layout for more details on how `position` differs between React Native and CSS.

| Type                         | Required |
| ---------------------------- | -------- |
| enum('absolute', 'relative') | No       |

---

### `right`

`right` is the number of logical pixels to offset the right edge of this component.

It works similarly to `right` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right for more details of how `right` affects layout.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `top`

`top` is the number of logical pixels to offset the top edge of this component.

It works similarly to `top` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top for more details of how `top` affects layout.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `width`

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |

---

### `zIndex`

`zIndex` controls which components display on top of others. Normally, you don't use `zIndex`. Components render according to their order in the document tree, so later components draw over earlier ones. `zIndex` may be useful if you have animations or custom modal interfaces where you don't want this behavior.

It works like the CSS `z-index` property - components with a larger `zIndex` will render on top. Think of the z-direction like it's pointing from the phone into your eyeball. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index for more details.

On iOS, `zIndex` may require `View`s to be siblings of each other for it to work as expected.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| number | No       |
