The Vibration API is exposed at `Vibration.vibrate()`. The vibration is asynchronous so this method will return immediately.

There will be no effect on devices that do not support Vibration, eg. the simulator.

Note for android add `<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE"/>` to `AndroidManifest.xml`

Vibration patterns are currently unsupported.
