title: Navigating Between Screens
---

Mobile apps are rarely made up of a single screen. Managing the presentation of, and transition between, multiple screens is typically handled by what is known as a navigator.

This guide points to the various navigation components available in React Native. If you are getting started with navigation, you will probably want to use [React Navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation). React Navigation provides a straightforward navigation solution, with the ability to present common stack navigation and tabbed navigation patterns on both Android and iOS.

If you're integrating React Native into an app that already manages navigation natively, or looking for an alternative to React Navigation, the following library provides native navigation on both platforms: [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation).

## React Navigation

The community solution to navigation is a standalone library that allows developers to set up the screens of an app with a few lines of code.

For a complete intro to React Navigation, follow the [React Navigation Getting Started Guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).

## React Native Navigation

As stated above, [react-native-navigation](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation) is another solution for navigation in react native
applications. It is a library that offers solutions for both basic and advance navigations.
