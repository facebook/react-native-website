# Reference

## Props

### `marginRight`

`marginRight` works like `margin-right` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin-right.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `alignItems`

`alignItems` aligns children in the cross direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `alignItems` controls how they align horizontally. It works like `align-items` in CSS, except the default value is `stretch` instead of `flex-start`. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/align-items/ for more detail.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |


| ReactPropTypes.oneOf([ 'flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'stretch' ]) | No |

---

### `borderBottomWidth`

`borderBottomWidth` works like `border-bottom-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-bottom_width.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `borderLeftWidth`

`borderLeftWidth` works like `border-left-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-bottom_width.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `borderRightWidth`

`borderRightWidth` works like `border-right-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-right_width.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `borderTopWidth`

`borderTopWidth` works like `border-top-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-top_width.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `borderWidth`

`borderWidth` works like `border-width` in CSS. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_border-width.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `bottom`

`bottom` is the number of logical pixels to offset the bottom edge of this component.

It works similarly to `bottom` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/bottom for more details of how `top` affects layout.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `flex`

In React Native `flex` does not work the same way that it does in CSS. `flex` is a number rather than a string, and it works according to the `css-layout` library at https://github.com/facebook/css-layout .

When `flex` is a positive number, it makes the component flexible and it will be sized proportional to its flex value. So a component with `flex` set to 2 will take twice the space as a component with `flex` set to 1.

When `flex` is 0, the component is sized according to `width` and `height` and it is inflexible.

When `flex` is -1, the component is normally sized according `width` and `height`. However, if there's not enough space, the component will shrink to its `minWidth` and `minHeight`.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `flexDirection`

`flexDirection` controls which directions children of a container go. `row` goes left to right, `column` goes top to bottom, and you may be able to guess what the other two do. It works like `flex-direction` in CSS, except the default is `column`. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-direction/ for more detail.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |


| ReactPropTypes.oneOf([ 'row', 'row-reverse', 'column', 'column-reverse' ]) | No |

---

### `flexWrap`

`flexWrap` controls whether children can wrap around after they hit the end of a flex container. It works like `flex-wrap` in CSS. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/flex-wrap/ for more detail.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |


| ReactPropTypes.oneOf([ 'wrap', 'nowrap' ]) | No |

---

### `height`

`height` sets the height of this component.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `justifyContent`

`justifyContent` aligns children in the main direction. For example, if children are flowing vertically, `justifyContent` controls how they align vertically. It works like `justify-content` in CSS. See https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/j/justify-content/ for more detail.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |


| ReactPropTypes.oneOf([ 'flex-start', 'flex-end', 'center', 'space-between', 'space-around' ]) | No |

---

### `left`

`left` is the number of logical pixels to offset the left edge of this component.

It works similarly to `left` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/left for more details of how `left` affects layout.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |

| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `position`

`position` in React Native is similar to regular CSS, but everything is set to `relative` by default, so `absolute` positioning is always just relative to the parent.

If you want to position a child using specific numbers of logical pixels relative to its parent, set the child to have `absolute` position.

If you want to position a child relative to something that is not its parent, just don't use styles for that. Use the component tree.

See https://github.com/facebook/css-layout for more details on how `position` differs between React Native and CSS.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |


| ReactPropTypes.oneOf([ 'absolute', 'relative' ]) | No |

---

### `right`

`right` is the number of logical pixels to offset the right edge of this component.

It works similarly to `right` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/right for more details of how `right` affects layout.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `top`

`top` is the number of logical pixels to offset the top edge of this component.

It works similarly to `top` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that.

See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/top for more details of how `top` affects layout.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `width`

`width` sets the width of this component.

It works similarly to `width` in CSS, but in React Native you must use logical pixel units, rather than percents, ems, or any of that. See http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_dim_width.asp for more details.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |

---

### `zIndex`

`zIndex` controls which components display on top of others. Normally, you don't use `zIndex`. Components render according to their order in the document tree, so later components draw over earlier ones. `zIndex` may be useful if you have animations or custom modal interfaces where you don't want this behavior.

It works like the CSS `z-index` property - components with a larger `zIndex` will render on top. Think of the z-direction like it's pointing from the phone into your eyeball. See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index for more detail.

On iOS, `zIndex` may require `View`s to be siblings of each other for it to work as expected.

| Type                  | Required |
| --------------------- | -------- |
| ReactPropTypes.number | No       |
