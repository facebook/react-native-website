## Terms

- **VirtualizedList:** The component behind `FlatList` (React Native's implementation of the '[Virtual List](https://bvaughn.github.io/react-virtualized/#/components/List)' concept.)

- **Memory consumption:** How much information about your list is being stored in memory, which could lead to a app crash.

- **Responsiveness:** Application ability to respond to interactions. Low responsiveness, for instance, is when you touch on a component and it waits a bit to respond, instead of responding immediately as expected.

- **Blank areas:** When `VirtualizedList` couldn't render your items fast enough, you enter on a part of your list with non rendered components.

- **Window:** The viewport (the area size in which items should be rendered).

## Props

Here are a list of props that can help to improve the `FlatList`:

### removeClippedSubviews

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| Boolean | False   |

If `true`, unmount components that are off of the window.

**Pros:** This is very memory friendly, as you will always have a little amount of rendered items instead of the whole list.

**Cons:** Be aware that this implementation can have bugs, such as missing content (mainly observed on iOS) if you use it on a component that will not unmount (such as a root navigation scene). It also can be less performant, having choppy scroll animations for big lists with complex items on old devices, as it makes complicated calculations per scroll.

### maxToRenderPerBatch

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 10      |

It is a `VirtualizedList` prop that can be passed directly to `FlatList`. Control the amount of items rendered per batch, which is the next chunk of items rendered on every scroll.

**Pros:** Setting a bigger number means less visual blank areas when scrolling (a better the fill rate).

**Cons:** More items per batch means less javascript performance, which means less responsiveness (clicking a item and opening the detail). If you have a static and non-interactive list, this could be the way to go.

### updateCellsBatchingPeriod

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 50      |

While `maxToRenderPerBatch` tells the amount of items rendered per batch, setting `updateCellsBatchingPeriod` tells to your `VirtualizedList` the delay in milliseconds between batch renders (how frequently your component will be rendering the windowed items).

**Pros:** Combining this prop with `maxToRenderPerBatch` gives you the power to, for example, render more items in a less frequent batch, or less items in a more frequent batch.

**Cons:** Less frequent batches may cause blank areas, More frequent batches may cause responsiveness and performance loss.

### initialNumToRender

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 10      |

The initial amount of items to render.

**Pros:** Define precise number of items that would cover the screen for every device. This can be a big performance boost when rendering the list component.

**Cons:** Setting a low `initialNumToRender` may cause to see blank areas.

### windowSize

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| Number | 21      |

The number passed here is a measurement unit where 1 is equivalent to your viewport height. The default value is 21 (10 viewports above, 10 below, and one in between).

**Pros:** Bigger `windowSize` will result in less blank space while scrolling (more performance). On the other hand, Smaller `windowSize` will result in to render smaller list (less memory consumption).

**Cons:** For a bigger `windowSize`, you will have a bigger memory consumption. For a lower `windowSize`, you will have lower performance and bigger chance of seeing blank areas.

### legacyImplementation

| Type    | Default |
| ------- | ------- |
| Boolean | False   |

Make `FlatList` rely on the older `ListView` instead of `VirtualizedList`.

**Pros:** This will make your list definitely perform better, as it removes virtualization and render all your items at once.

**Cons:** Extra memory consumption and more app crash risk in large lists (100+) with complex items. It also warns that the above tweaks will not work because now it is using `ListView`.

## List items

There are also some tips about list item components. They are being managed by `VirtualizedList` a lot, so they need to be fast.

### Use simple components

The more complex your components are, the slower they will render. Try to avoid a lot of logic and nesting in your list items. If you are reusing this list item component a lot in your app, create a component just for your big lists and make them with less logic and less nested as possible.

### Use light components

The heavier your components are, the slower they render. Avoid heavy images (use a cropped version or thumbnail for list items, as small as possible). Talk to your design team, use as little effects and interactions and information as possible in your list. Show them in your item's detail.

### Use shouldComponentUpdate

Implement update verification to your components. React's `PureComponent` implement a [`shouldComponentUpdate`](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#shouldcomponentupdate) with shallow comparison. This is expensive here because it need to check all your props. If you want a good bit-level performance, create the strictest rules for your list item components, checking only props that could potentially change. If your list is simple enough, you could even use

```javascript
    shouldComponentUpdate() {
      return false
    }
```

### Use cached optimized images

You can use the community packages (such as [react-native-fast-image](https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image) from [@DylanVann](https://github.com/DylanVann)) for more performant images. Every image in your list is a `new Image()` instance. The faster it reaches the `loaded` hook, the faster your Javascript thread will be free again.

### Use getItemLayout

If all your list item components have the same height (or width, for a horizontal list), passing [getItemLayout](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist#getitemlayout) prop removes the need for your `FlatList` to dynamically calculate it every time. This is a very desirable optimization technique.

If your components have dynamic size and you really need performance, consider asking your design team if they may think of a redesign in order to perform better.

### Use keyExtractor or key

You can set the [`keyExtractor`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flatlist#keyextractor) to your `FlatList` component. This prop is used for caching and as the React `key` to track item re-ordering.

You can also use a `key` prop in you item component.

### Avoid anonymous function on renderItem

Move out the `renderItem` function to the outside of render function, so it won't recreate itself each time render function called.

```javascript
renderItem = ({ item }) => (<View key={item.key}><Text>{item.title}</Text></View>);

render(){
  // ...

  <FlatList
    data={items}
    renderItem={renderItem}
  />

  // ...
}
```
