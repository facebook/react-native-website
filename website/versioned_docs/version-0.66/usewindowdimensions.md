```jsx
import { useWindowDimensions } from 'react-native';
```

`useWindowDimensions` hook automatically updates all of its values when screen size or font scale changes. You can get your application window's width and height like so:

```jsx
const { height, width } = useWindowDimensions();
```

## Example

```SnackPlayer name=useWindowDimensions&supportedPlatforms=ios,android
import React from "react";
import { View, StyleSheet, Text, useWindowDimensions } from "react-native";

const App = () => {
  const { height, width, scale, fontScale } = useWindowDimensions();
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Text style={styles.header}>
        Window Dimension Data
      </Text>
      <Text>Height: {height}</Text>
      <Text>Width: {width}</Text>
      <Text>Font scale: {fontScale}</Text>
      <Text>Pixel ratio: {scale}</Text>
    </View>
  );
}
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    justifyContent: "center",
    alignItems: "center"
  },
  header: {
    fontSize: 20,
    marginBottom: 12
  }
});

export default App;
```

- The [`useDimensions`](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks#usedimensions) hook from the community [React Native Hooks](https://github.com/react-native-community/hooks) library aims to make handling screen/window size changes easier to work with.
- [React Native Responsive Dimensions](https://github.com/react-native-toolkit/react-native-responsive-dimensions) also comes with responsive hooks.
