A component's height and width determine its size on the screen.

## Fixed Dimensions

The general way to set the dimensions of a component is by adding a fixed `width` and `height` to style. All dimensions in React Native are unitless, and represent density-independent pixels.

```SnackPlayer name=Height%20and%20Width
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const FixedDimensionsBasics = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <View style={{
        width: 50, height: 50, backgroundColor: 'powderblue'
      }} />
      <View style={{
        width: 100, height: 100, backgroundColor: 'skyblue'
      }} />
      <View style={{
        width: 150, height: 150, backgroundColor: 'steelblue'
      }} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default FixedDimensionsBasics;
```

Setting dimensions this way is common for components whose size should always be fixed to a number of points and not calculated based on screen size.

> There is no universal mapping from points to physical units of measurement. This means that a component with fixed dimensions might not have the same physical size, across different devices and screen sizes. However, this difference is unnoticable for most use cases.

## Flex Dimensions

Use `flex` in a component's style to have the component expand and shrink dynamically based on available space. Normally you will use `flex: 1`, which tells a component to fill all available space, shared evenly amongst other components with the same parent. The larger the `flex` given, the higher the ratio of space a component will take compared to its siblings.

> A component can only expand to fill available space if its parent has dimensions greater than `0`. If a parent does not have either a fixed `width` and `height` or `flex`, the parent will have dimensions of `0` and the `flex` children will not be visible.

```SnackPlayer name=Flex%20Dimensions
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const FlexDimensionsBasics = () => {
  return (
    // Try removing the `flex: 1` on the parent View.
    // The parent will not have dimensions, so the children can't expand.
    // What if you add `height: 300` instead of `flex: 1`?
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'powderblue' }} />
      <View style={{ flex: 2, backgroundColor: 'skyblue' }} />
      <View style={{ flex: 3, backgroundColor: 'steelblue' }} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default FlexDimensionsBasics;
```

After you can control a component's size, the next step is to [learn how to lay it out on the screen](flexbox.md).

## Percentage Dimensions

If you want to fill a certain portion of the screen, but you _don't_ want to use the `flex` layout, you _can_ use **percentage values** in the component's style. Similar to flex dimensions, percentage dimensions require parent with a defined size.

```SnackPlayer name=Percentage%20Dimensions
import React from 'react';
import { View } from 'react-native';

const PercentageDimensionsBasics = () => {
  // Try removing the `height: '100%'` on the parent View.
  // The parent will not have dimensions, so the children can't expand.
  return (
    <View style={{ height: '100%' }}>
      <View style={{
        height: '15%', backgroundColor: 'powderblue'
      }} />
      <View style={{
        width: '66%', height: '35%', backgroundColor: 'skyblue'
      }} />
      <View style={{
        width: '33%', height: '50%', backgroundColor: 'steelblue'
      }} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default PercentageDimensionsBasics;
```
