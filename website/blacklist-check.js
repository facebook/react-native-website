/**
 * Docusaurus provides us with an easy way to keep snapshots of the docs for
 * each version of React Native. As a result, people can go back and see what a
 * View component looked like in any past React Native release.
 *
 * This is less relevant for "evergreen" content such as the Getting Started
 * guide, the Tutorial, and basically the rest of the Guides. These docs should
 * be getting updated across all versions at the same time. This script makes
 * sure we are not tracking separate versions of a unversioned doc.
 *
 * We achieve this by ensuring any changes made to these files in `docs/` are
 * then persisted to the `versioned_docs/version-0.5` folder, as Version 0.5
 * is the oldest document version. This makes it so that the same text is
 * displayed to the reader, regardless of what version they are looking at.
