          <h2>Where To Get Help</h2>
          <p>
            If you need help with your React Native app, the right place to go
            depends on the type of help that you need.
          </p>
          <h3>Repository</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>React Native</strong> is worked on full-time by Facebook's
            product infrastructure engineering team. But there are far more
            people in the community who make key contributions and fix things;
            if the issue you are facing is code related, you should consider
            checking the open issues in the main repo and create a new one
            following the template if it's something none faced yet.
          </p>
          <h3>Stack Overflow</h3>
          <p>
            Many members of the community use Stack Overflow to ask questions.

          <h3>Discussion Forum</h3>
          <p>
            For longer-form conversations about React Native, weâ€™ve set up a{" "}
            <a href="https://discuss.reactjs.org/t/welcome-react-native-community-group/10239">
              discussion forum at <strong>discuss.reactjs.org</strong>
            </a>. This forum is a great place for discussion about best
            practices and application architecture as well as the future of
            React Native. If you have an answerable code-level question, please
            post it to Stack Overflow instead.

          <h3>Conferences</h3>
          <p>
            There are a lot of [React Native
            Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/topics/react-native/) that happen
            around the world. Often there is React Native content in React
            meetups as well. Sometimes we have React conferences. We posted the
            [videos from React.js Conf
            2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS3fZ46IGFirdqKTIxlws7e0),
            [React.js Conf
            2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY),
            and [React.js Conf
            2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS1cbw4qonlQztYV1TAW0sCr&v=KVZ-P-ZI6W4).
            We'll probably have more conferences in the future, too. Stay tuned.
            You can also find a list of dedicated React Native conferences
            [here](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/#conferences).
