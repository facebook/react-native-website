title: PanResponder
---

`PanResponder` reconciles several touches into a single gesture. It makes single-touch gestures resilient to extra touches, and can be used to recognize simple multi-touch gestures.

By default, `PanResponder` holds an `InteractionManager` handle to block long-running JS events from interrupting active gestures.

It provides a predictable wrapper of the responder handlers provided by the [gesture responder system](gesture-responder-system.md). For each handler, it provides a new `gestureState` object alongside the native event object:

```
onPanResponderMove: (event, gestureState) => {}
```

A native event is a synthetic touch event with the following form:

- `nativeEvent`
  - `changedTouches` - Array of all touch events that have changed since the last event
  - `identifier` - The ID of the touch
  - `locationX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the element
  - `locationY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the element
  - `pageX` - The X position of the touch, relative to the root element
  - `pageY` - The Y position of the touch, relative to the root element
  - `target` - The node id of the element receiving the touch event
  - `timestamp` - A time identifier for the touch, useful for velocity calculation
  - `touches` - Array of all current touches on the screen

A `gestureState` object has the following:

- `stateID` - ID of the gestureState- persisted as long as there at least one touch on screen
- `moveX` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
- `moveY` - the latest screen coordinates of the recently-moved touch
- `x0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
- `y0` - the screen coordinates of the responder grant
- `dx` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
- `dy` - accumulated distance of the gesture since the touch started
- `vx` - current velocity of the gesture
- `vy` - current velocity of the gesture
- `numberActiveTouches` - Number of touches currently on screen

### Basic Usage

```javascript
class ExampleComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this._panResponder = PanResponder.create({
      // Ask to be the responder:
      onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (evt, gestureState) => true,

      onPanResponderGrant: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The gesture has started. Show visual feedback so the user knows
        // what is happening!
        // gestureState.d{x,y} will be set to zero now
      },
      onPanResponderMove: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The most recent move distance is gestureState.move{X,Y}
        // The accumulated gesture distance since becoming responder is
        // gestureState.d{x,y}
      },
      onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (evt, gestureState) => true,
      onPanResponderRelease: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // The user has released all touches while this view is the
        // responder. This typically means a gesture has succeeded
      },
      onPanResponderTerminate: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // Another component has become the responder, so this gesture
        // should be cancelled
      },
      onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (evt, gestureState) => {
        // Returns whether this component should block native components from becoming the JS
        // responder. Returns true by default. Is currently only supported on android.
        return true;
      },
    });
  }

  render() {
    return <View {...this._panResponder.panHandlers} />;
  }
}
```

## Methods

### `create()`

```javascript
static create(config)
```

@param {object} config Enhanced versions of all of the responder callbacks that provide not only the typical `ResponderSyntheticEvent`, but also the `PanResponder` gesture state. Simply replace the word `Responder` with `PanResponder` in each of the typical `onResponder*` callbacks. For example, the `config` object would look like:

- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onMoveShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onStartShouldSetPanResponderCapture: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderReject: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderGrant: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderStart: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderEnd: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderRelease: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderMove: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderTerminate: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onPanResponderTerminationRequest: (e, gestureState) => {...}`
- `onShouldBlockNativeResponder: (e, gestureState) => {...}`

In general, for events that have capture equivalents, we update the gestureState once in the capture phase and can use it in the bubble phase as well.

Be careful with `onStartShould*` callbacks. They only reflect updated `gestureState` for start/end events that bubble/capture to the Node. Once the node is the responder, you can rely on every start/end event being processed by the gesture and `gestureState` being updated accordingly. (numberActiveTouches) may not be totally accurate unless you are the responder.
