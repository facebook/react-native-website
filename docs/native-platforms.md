Your application may need access to platform features that arenâ€™t directly available from react-native or one of the hundreds of [third-party libraries](https://reactnative.directory/) maintained by the community. Maybe you want to reuse some existing Objective-C, Swift, Java, Kotlin or C++ code from the JavaScript runtime. Whatever your reason, React Native exposes a powerful set of API to connect your native code to your JavaScript application code.

This guide introduces:

- **Native Modules:** native libraries that have no User Interface (UI) for the user. Examples would be persistent storage, notifications, network events. These are accessible to your user as JavaScript functions and objects.
- **Native Component:** native platform views, widgets and controllers that are available to your application's JavaScript code through React Components.

:::note
You might have previously been familiar with:

- [Legacy Native Modules](./legacy/native-modules-intro);
- [Legacy Native Components](./legacy/native-components-android);

These are our deprecated native module and component API. You can still use many of these legacy libraries with the New Architecture thanks to our interop layers. You should consider:

- using alternative libraries,
- upgrading to newer library versions that have first-class support for the New Architecture, or
- port these libraries yourself to Turbo Native Modules or Fabric Native Components.
