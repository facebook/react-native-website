Congratulations! You built your first React Native app. But there’s more to learn: developer workflows, shipping to app stores, internationalization, security and more.

## Where to go from here

- [Set up your environment](environment-setup)
- [Set up your development workflow](running-on-device)
- [Design and layout your app](flexbox)
- [Debug your app](debugging)
- [Make your app cross platform](platform-specific-code)
- [Get involved in the React Native community](/help)

## Dive deep

- [React’s Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html)
- [MDN’s JavaScript tutorials, reference, and guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Android](https://developer.android.com/docs) and [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit) platform docs

## IDEs

We recommend using the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) code editor and its handy [React Native tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native).

## Platforms to try

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io/) is a framework of tools and services for React Native that focuses on letting you build React Native apps without ever touching Xcode or Android Studio. If you have a web development background, this might appeal to you.

[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) is a starter kit that uses Redux for state management and a few different common UI libraries. It has a CLI to generate apps, components, and containers. If you like all of the individual tech choices, Ignite could be perfect for you.

## Example Apps

Try out apps from the [Showcase](https://reactnative.dev/showcase) to see what React Native is capable of! Looking for something more hands on? Check out this [set of example apps on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactNativeNews/React-Native-Apps). You can look at their source code—try running one on a simulator or device.

## Find, make, and share your own Native Components and Modules

React Native has a community of thousands of developers like you making content, tools, tutorials—and Native Components!

Can’t find what you’re looking for in the Core Components? Visit [React Native Directory](https://reactnative.directory) to find what the community has been creating.

Interested in making your own Native Component or Module? Making modules for your own use case and sharing them with others on NPM and GitHub helps grow the React Native ecosystem and community! Read the guides to making your own Native Modules ([Android](native-modules-android.md), [iOS](native-modules-ios.md)) and Native Components ([Android](native-components-android.md), [iOS](native-components-ios.md)).
