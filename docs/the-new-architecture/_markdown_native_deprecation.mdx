Native Module and Native Components are our stable technologies used by the legacy architecture.
They will be deprecated in the future when the New Architecture will be stable. The New Architecture uses [Turbo Native Module](./the-new-architecture/pillars-turbomodules) and [Fabric Native Components](./the-new-architecture/pillars-fabric-components) to achieve similar results.
