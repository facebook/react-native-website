# The Codegen CLI

Calling Gradle or manually calling a script might be hard to remember and it requires a lot of cerimony.

To simplify it, we created a CLI tool that can help you running those tasks: the **Codegen** cli.

```shell
npx react-native codegen [--path path] [--platform string] [--outputPath path]
```

This command runs [react-native-codegen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-codegen) for your project. The following options are available:

- `--path` - Path to `package.json`. The default path is the current working directory.
- `--platform` - Target platform. Supported values: `android`, `ios`, `all`. The default value is `all`.
- `--outputPath` - Output path. The default value is the value defined in `codegenConfig.outputDir`.

## Examples

- Read `package.json` from the current working directory, generate code based on its codegenConfig.

```shell
npx react-native codegen
```

- Read `package.json` from the current working directory, generate iOS code in the location defined in the codegenConfig.

```shell
npx react-native codegen --platform ios
```

- Read `package.json` from `third-party/some-library`, generate Android code in `third-party/some-library/android/generated`.

```shell
npx react-native codegen \
    --path third-party/some-library \
    --platform android \
    --outputPath third-party/some-library/android/generated
```

## Including Generated Code into Libraries

The **Codegen** CLI is a great tool for library developers. It can be used to peek at the generated code to see which interfaces you need to implement. Or you can generate the code if you want to ship it in your library.

This setup has several benefits:

- No need to rely on the app to run **Codegen** for you, the generated code is always there.
- The implementation files are always consistent with the generated interfaces.
- No need to include two sets of files to support both architectures on Android. You can only keep the New Architecture one, and it is guaranteed to be backwards compatible.
- No need to worry about **Codegen** version mismatch between what is used by the app, and what was used during library development.
- Since all native code is there, it is possible to ship the native part of the library as a prebuild.

To enable this setup:

- Add the `includesGeneratedCode` property into your library's `codegenConfig` field in the `package.json` file. Set its value to `true`.
- Run **Codegen** locally with the codegen CLI.
- Update your `package.json` to include the generated code.
- Update your `podspec` to include the generated code.
- Update your `build.Gradle` file to include the generated code.
- Update `cmakeListsPath` in `react-native.config.js` so that Gradle doesn't look for CMakeLists file in the build directory but instead in your outputDir.
