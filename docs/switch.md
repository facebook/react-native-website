title: Switch
---

Renders a boolean input.

This is a controlled component that requires an `onValueChange` callback that updates the `value` prop in order for the component to reflect user actions. If the `value` prop is not updated, the component will continue to render the supplied `value` prop instead of the expected result of any user actions.
