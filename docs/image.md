title: Image
---

A React component for displaying different types of images, including network images, static resources, temporary local images, and images from local disk, such as the camera roll.

This example shows fetching and displaying an image from local storage as well as one from network and even from data provided in the `'data:'` uri scheme.

> Note that for network and data images, you will need to manually specify the dimensions of your image!

## Examples

```SnackPlayer name=Example
import React from 'react';
import {View, Image, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingTop: 50,
  },
  tinyLogo: {
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
  },
  logo: {
    width: 66,
    height: 58,
  },
});

const DisplayAnImage = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image
        style={styles.tinyLogo}
        source={require('@expo/snack-static/react-native-logo.png')}
      />
      <Image
        style={styles.tinyLogo}
        source={{
          uri: 'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png',
        }}
      />
      <Image
        style={styles.logo}
        source={{
          uri: 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAADMAAAAzCAYAAAA6oTAqAAAAEXRFWHRTb2Z0d2FyZQBwbmdjcnVzaEB1SfMAAABQSURBVGje7dSxCQBACARB+2/ab8BEeQNhFi6WSYzYLYudDQYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgZmcvDqYGBgmhivGQYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgYGBgbmQw+P/eMrC5UTVAAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==',
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default DisplayAnImage;
```

You can also add `style` to an image:

```SnackPlayer name=Example
import React from 'react';
import {View, Image, StyleSheet} from 'react-native';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    paddingTop: 50,
  },
  stretch: {
    width: 50,
    height: 200,
    resizeMode: 'stretch',
  },
});

const DisplayAnImageWithStyle = () => {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <Image
        style={styles.stretch}
        source={require('@expo/snack-static/react-native-logo.png')}
      />
    </View>
  );
};

export default DisplayAnImageWithStyle;
```

## GIF and WebP support on Android

When building your own native code, GIF and WebP are not supported by default on Android.

You will need to add some optional modules in `android/app/build.gradle`, depending on the needs of your app.

```groovy
dependencies {
  // If your app supports Android versions before Ice Cream Sandwich (API level 14)
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-base-support:1.3.0'

  // For animated GIF support
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-gif:2.5.0'

  // For WebP support, including animated WebP
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:animated-webp:2.5.0'
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:2.5.0'

  // For WebP support, without animations
  implementation 'com.facebook.fresco:webpsupport:2.5.0'
}
```

> Note: the version listed above may not be updated in time. Please check [`ReactAndroid/gradle.properties`](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/ReactAndroid/gradle.properties) in the main repo to see which fresco version is being used in a specific tagged version.

# Reference

## Props

### [View Props](view.md#props)

Inherits [View Props](view#props).

---

### `accessible`

When true, indicates the image is an accessibility element.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

### `accessibilityLabel`

The text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the image.

| Type   |
| ------ |

---

### `capInsets` <div class="label ios">iOS</div>

When the image is resized, the corners of the size specified by `capInsets` will stay a fixed size, but the center content and borders of the image will be stretched. This is useful for creating resizable rounded buttons, shadows, and other resizable assets. More info in the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImage_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIImage/resizableImageWithCapInsets).

| ------------ |
| [Rect](rect) |

---

### `crossOrigin`

A string of a keyword specifying the CORS mode to use when fetching the image resource. It works similar to crossorigin attribute in HTML.

- `anonymous`: No exchange of user credentials in the image request.
- `use-credentials`: Sets `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header value to `true` in the image request.

| Type                                     | Default       |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------- |

| Type                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `md ({nativeEvent: [LayoutEvent](layoutevent)} => void` |

---

### `onLoad`

| Type       |
| ---------- |
| () => void |

---

### `onPartialLoad` <div class="label ios">iOS</div>

When `true`, enables progressive jpeg streaming - https://frescolib.org/docs/progressive-jpegs.

| Type | Default |
| ---- | ------- |
| bool | `false` |

---

### `resizeMethod` <div class="label android">Android</div>

The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.

- `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.

- `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger than the view.

- `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the image is slightly bigger than the view.

More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at https://frescolib.org/docs/resizing.

| Type                                  | Default  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------- |
| enum(`'auto'`, `'resize'`, `'scale'`) | `'auto'` |

---

### `referrerPolicy`

A string indicating which referrer to use when fetching the resource. Sets the value for `Referrer-Policy` header in the image request. Works similar to `referrerpolicy` attribute in HTML.

| Type                                                                                                                                                                                     | Default                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| enum(`'no-referrer'`, `'no-referrer-when-downgrade'`, `'origin'`, `'origin-when-cross-origin'`, `'same-origin'`, `'strict-origin'`, `'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'`, `'unsafe-url'`) | `'strict-origin-when-cross-origin'` |

---

### `resizeMode`

Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw image dimensions. Defaults to `cover`.

- `cover`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that

  - both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)
  - at least one dimension of the scaled image will be equal to the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding)

- `contain`: Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).

- `stretch`: Scale width and height independently, This may change the aspect ratio of the src.

- `repeat`: Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view. The image will keep its size and aspect ratio, unless it is larger than the view, in which case it will be scaled down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

- `center`: Center the image in the view along both dimensions. If the image is larger than the view, scale it down uniformly so that it is contained in the view.

| Type                                                              | Default   |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| enum(`'cover'`, `'contain'`, `'stretch'`, `'repeat'`, `'center'`) | `'cover'` |

---

### `source`

The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).

This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments. The native side will then choose the best `uri` to display based on the measured size of the image container. A `cache` property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache. (For more information see [Cache Control for Images](images#cache-control-ios-only)).

The currently supported formats are `png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `bmp`, `gif`, `webp`, `psd` (iOS only). In addition, iOS supports several RAW image formats. Refer to Apple's documentation for the current list of supported camera models (for iOS 12, see https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT208967).

| Type                             |
| -------------------------------- |
| [ImageSource](image#imagesource) |

---

### `src`

A string representing the remote URL of the image. This prop has precedence over `source` prop.

**Example:** `src={'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png'}`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `srcSet`

A string representing comma separated list of possible candidate image source. Each image source contains a URL of an image and a pixel density descriptor. If no descriptor is specified, it defaults to descriptor of `1x`.

If `srcSet` does not contain a `1x` descriptor, the value in `src` is used as image source with `1x` descriptor (if provided).

This prop has precedence over both the `src` and `source` props.

**Example:** `srcSet={'https://reactnative.dev/img/tiny_logo.png 1x, https://reactnative.dev/img/header_logo.svg 2x'}`

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `style`

| Type                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Image Style Props](image-style-props#props), [Layout Props](layout-props#props), [Shadow Props](shadow-props#props), [Transforms](transforms#props) |

---

### `testID`

A unique identifier for this element to be used in UI Automation testing scripts.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| string |

---

### `tintColor`

Changes the color of all non-transparent pixels to the `tintColor`.

| Type               |
| ------------------ |
| [color](colors.md) |

---

### `width`

Width of the image component.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

## Methods

### `abortPrefetch()` <div class="label android">Android</div>

```tsx
static abortPrefetch(requestId: number);
```

Abort prefetch request.

**Parameters:**

| Name                                                       | Type   | Description                             |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| requestId <div class="label basic required">Required</div> | number | Request id as returned by `prefetch()`. |

---

### `getSize()`

```tsx
static getSize(
  uri: string,
  success: (width: number, height: number) => void,
  failure?: (error: any) => void,
): any;
```

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it. This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to preload images will be provided as a separate API.

**Parameters:**

| <div className="wideColumn">Name</div>                   | Type     | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| uri <div class="label basic required">Required</div>     | string   | The location of the image.                                                                           |
| success <div class="label basic required">Required</div> | function | The function that will be called if the image was successfully found and width and height retrieved. |
| failure                                                  | function | The function that will be called if there was an error, such as failing to retrieve the image.       |

---

### `getSizeWithHeaders()`

```tsx
static getSizeWithHeaders(
  uri: string,
  headers: {[index: string]: string},
  success: (width: number, height: number) => void,
  failure?: (error: any) => void,
): any;
```

Retrieve the width and height (in pixels) of an image prior to displaying it with the ability to provide the headers for the request. This method can fail if the image cannot be found, or fails to download. It also does not work for static image resources.

In order to retrieve the image dimensions, the image may first need to be loaded or downloaded, after which it will be cached. This means that in principle you could use this method to preload images, however it is not optimized for that purpose, and may in future be implemented in a way that does not fully load/download the image data. A proper, supported way to preload images will be provided as a separate API.

**Parameters:**

| uri <div class="label basic required">Required</div>     | string   | The location of the image.                                                                           |
| headers <div class="label basic required">Required</div> | object   | The headers for the request.                                                                         |
| success <div class="label basic required">Required</div> | function | The function that will be called if the image was successfully found and width and height retrieved. |
| failure                                                  | function | The function that will be called if there was an error, such as failing to retrieve the image.       |

| source <div class="label basic required">Required</div> | [ImageSource](image#imagesource), number | A number (opaque type returned by `require('./foo.png')`) or an ImageSource. |

## Type Definitions

### ImageCacheEnum <div class="label ios">iOS</div>

Enum which can be used to set the cache handling or stategy for the potentially cached responses.

| Type                                                               | Default     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| enum(`'default'`, `'reload'`, `'force-cache'`, `'only-if-cached'`) | `'default'` |

- `default`: Use the native platforms default strategy.
- `reload`: The data for the URL will be loaded from the originating source. No existing cache data should be used to satisfy a URL load request.
- `force-cache`: The existing cached data will be used to satisfy the request, regardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding the request, the data is loaded from the originating source.
- `only-if-cached`: The existing cache data will be used to satisfy a request, regardless of its age or expiration date. If there is no existing data in the cache corresponding to a URL load request, no attempt is made to load the data from the originating source, and the load is considered to have failed.

### ImageLoadEvent

Object returned in the `onLoad` callback.

| Type   |
| ------ |
