## Installing dependencies

You will need Node, Watchman, the React Native command line interface, Xcode and CocoaPods.

While you can use any editor of your choice to develop your app, you will need to install Xcode in order to set up the necessary tooling to build your React Native app for iOS.

### Node & Watchman

We recommend installing Node and Watchman using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew:

```shell
brew install node
brew install watchman
```

If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 18 or newer.

[Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman) is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

### Xcode

Please use the **latest version** of Xcode.

The easiest way to install Xcode is via the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). Installing Xcode will also install the iOS Simulator and all the necessary tools to build your iOS app.

#### Command Line Tools

You will also need to install the Xcode Command Line Tools. Open Xcode, then choose **Settings... (or Preferences...)** from the Xcode menu. Go to the Locations panel and install the tools by selecting the most recent version in the Command Line Tools dropdown.

#### Installing an iOS Simulator in Xcode

To install a simulator, open **Xcode > Settings... (or Preferences...)** and select the **Platforms (or Components)** tab. Select a simulator with the corresponding version of iOS you wish to use.

If you are using Xcode version 14.0 or greater than to install a simulator, open **Xcode > Settings > Platforms** tab, then click "+" icon and select **iOSâ€¦** option.

#### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) is one of the dependency management system available for iOS. CocoaPods is a Ruby [gem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems). You can install CocoaPods using the version of Ruby that ships with the latest version of macOS.

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

### [Optional] Configuring your environment

Starting from React Native version 0.69, it is possible to configure the Xcode environment using the `.xcode.env` file provided by the template.

The `.xcode.env` file contains an environment variable to export the path to the `node` executable in the `NODE_BINARY` variable.
This is the **suggested approach** to decouple the build infrastructure from the system version of `node`. You should customize this variable with your own path or your own `node` version manager, if it differs from the default.

On top of this, it's possible to add any other environment variable and to source the `.xcode.env` file in your build script phases. If you need to run script that requires some specific environment, this is the **suggested approach**: it allows to decouple the build phases from a specific environment.

:::info
If you are already using [NVM](https://nvm.sh/) (a command which helps you install and switch between versions of Node.js) and [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/), you might want to move the code that initialize NVM from your `~/.zshrc` into a `~/.zshenv` file to help Xcode find your Node executable:

```zsh
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
```

You might also want to ensure that all "shell script build phase" of your Xcode project, is using `/bin/zsh` as its shell.

<h3>That's it!</h3>

Congratulations! You successfully set up your development environment.
