title: Publishing to Apple App Store
---

The publishing process is the same as any other native iOS app, with some additional considerations to take into account.

> If you are using Expo then read the Expo Guide for [Building Standalone Apps](https://docs.expo.dev/classic/building-standalone-apps/).

### 1. Enable App Transport Security

App Transport Security is a security feature introduced in iOS 9 that rejects all HTTP requests that are not sent over HTTPS. This can result in HTTP traffic being blocked, including the developer React Native server. ATS is disabled for `localhost` by default in React Native projects in order to make development easier.

You should re-enable ATS prior to building your app for production by removing the `localhost` entry from the `NSExceptionDomains` dictionary and setting `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` to `false` in your `Info.plist` file in the `ios/` folder. You can also re-enable ATS from within Xcode by opening your target properties under the Info pane and editing the App Transport Security Settings entry.

> If your application needs to access HTTP resources on production, learn how to configure ATS on your project.

### 2. Configure release scheme

Building an app for distribution in the App Store requires using the `Release` scheme in Xcode. Apps built for `Release` will automatically disable the in-app Developer menu, which will prevent your users from inadvertently accessing the menu in production. It will also bundle the JavaScript locally, so you can put the app on a device and test whilst not connected to the computer.

To configure your app to be built using the `Release` scheme, go to **Product** → **Scheme** → **Edit Scheme**. Select the **Run** tab in the sidebar, then set the Build Configuration dropdown to `Release`.

#### Pro Tips

As your App Bundle grows in size, you may start to see a blank screen flash between your splash screen and the display of your root application view. If this is the case, you can add the following code to `AppDelegate.m` in order to keep your splash screen displayed during the transition.

```objectivec
  // Place this code after "[self.window makeKeyAndVisible]" and before "return YES;"
  UIStoryboard *sb = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"LaunchScreen" bundle:nil];
  UIViewController *vc = [sb instantiateInitialViewController];
  rootView.loadingView = vc.view;
```

The static bundle is built every time you target a physical device, even in Debug. If you want to save time, turn off bundle generation in Debug by adding the following to your shell script in the Xcode Build Phase `Bundle React Native code and images`:

```shell
 if [ "${CONFIGURATION}" == "Debug" ]; then
  export SKIP_BUNDLING=true
 fi
```

### 3. Build app for release

You can now build your app for release by tapping `⌘B` or selecting **Product** → **Build** from the menu bar. Once built for release, you'll be able to distribute the app to beta testers and submit the app to the App Store.

> You can also use the `React Native CLI` to perform this operation using the option `--configuration` with the value `Release` (e.g. `npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release`).
