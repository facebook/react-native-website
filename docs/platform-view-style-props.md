# Reference

### `elevation`

> Android

Sets the elevation of a view, using Android's underlying [elevation API](https://developer.android.com/training/material/shadows-clipping.html#Elevation). This adds a drop shadow to the item and affects z-order for overlapping views. Only supported on Android 5.0+, has no effect on earlier versions.
