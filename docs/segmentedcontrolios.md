> **Deprecated.** Use [@react-native-community/segmented-control](https://github.com/react-native-community/segmented-control) instead.

Uses `SegmentedControlIOS` to render a UISegmentedControl iOS.

#### Programmatically changing selected index

The selected index can be changed on the fly by assigning the selectedIndex prop to a state variable, then changing that variable. Note that the state variable would need to be updated as the user selects a value and changes the index, as shown in the example below.

## Example

```SnackPlayer name=SegmentedControlIOS%20Example&supportedPlatforms=ios
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { SegmentedControlIOS, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";

export default App = () => {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <SegmentedControlIOS
        values={['One', 'Two']}
        selectedIndex={index}
        onChange={(event) => {
          setIndex(event.nativeEvent.selectedSegmentIndex);
        }}
      />
      <Text style={styles.text}>
        Selected index: {index}
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    padding: 24,
    justifyContent: "center"
  },
  text: {
    marginTop: 24
  }
});
```
