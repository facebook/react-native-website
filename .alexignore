# The Code of Conduct calls out language that can't be used so it's not linted.

# The version docs are actively being linted.
# If you want to lint one of these directories, remove it from the list here and then run:
#     `yarn lintv website/versioned_docs/version-{version number}/`
# Once you fix all of the errors, commit all of the changes including this file.
#
# To be considerate to the reviewer, please submit each version in different PRs.
